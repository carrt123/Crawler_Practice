{"title": "Breaking Barriers: The Link between Stronger IPRs and Trade in Services", "authors": ["Olena Ivus"], "publishing_date": "2024-05-06T13:50:00Z", "abstract": "As innovation becomes more prevalent and systematically integrated into service industries, service firms increasingly turn to intellectual property rights (IPRs) as a means of safeguarding their intellectual assets. The reliance on these legal rights becomes even more pronounced when service companies endeavour to expand their global reach and tap into international markets where the protection of IPRs is relatively weak, and imitation is more widespread. Disparities in the level of IPRs protection and enforcement across countries can pose significant barriers to cross-border trade and investment in service sectors where the safeguarding of intellectual property (IP) is fundamental. The risk of IP infringement and the limited protection afforded to patents, copyrights and trademarks in certain countries can discourage the expansion of businesses into these markets, limiting the overall growth and accessibility of services in those areas. This paper studies the relationship between trade in services and the strength of IPRs protection at the international level. More specifically, it uses data for 94 countries over the period of 1990–2010 to put forward new empirical evidence about the impact of global strengthening of IPRs protection on cross-border trade in services."},
{"title": "Explainable AI Policy: It Is Time to Challenge Post Hoc Explanations", "authors": ["Mardi Witzel", "Gaston H. Gonnet", "Tim Snider"], "publishing_date": "2024-07-18T13:00:00Z", "abstract": "The focus of this paper is on policy guidance around explainable artificial intelligence (AI) or the ability to understand how AI models arrive at their outcomes. Explainability matters in human terms because it facilitates including an individual’s “right to explanation” and it also plays a role in enabling technical evaluation of AI systems. The paper begins with an examination of the meaning of explainability, concluding that the constellation of related terms serves to frustrate and confuse policy initiatives. Following a brief review of contemporary policy guidance, it argues that there is a need for greater clarity and context-specific guidance, highlighting the need to distinguish between ante hoc and post hoc explainability, especially in high-risk, high-impact contexts. The question of whether post hoc or ante hoc methods have been employed is a fundamental and often-overlooked question in policy. The paper argues that the question of which method should be employed in a given context, along with the requirement for human-level understanding, is a key challenge that policy makers need to address. A taxonomy for how explainability can be operationalized in AI policy is proposed and a series of recommendations is set forth."},
{"title": "Dynamic Financial Markets, Static Regulatory Frameworks", "authors": ["James A. Haley"], "publishing_date": "2024-08-15T13:00:00Z", "abstract": "As financial sectors around the world keep pace with rapidly changing consumer needs, creating new products, services and financial market players, regulatory frameworks are struggling to keep up due to slow-moving, legally defined entities. The tension between dynamic markets and static regulatory frameworks means that risks may emerge faster than policies can be created to mitigate them and that new firms are operating outside regulatory boundaries. This paper recommends a hybrid approach that maintains the current entities-based regulatory frameworks while promoting more consistent regulation across the financial system to address emerging systemic risks."},
{"title": "Moving toward Best Practices in Accountability and Military Use of AI", "authors": ["Leah West"], "publishing_date": "2024-09-05T18:00:00Z", "abstract": "In February 2023, the Netherlands hosted the inaugural global summit on the Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence in the Military Domain, culminating in the endorsement of the “Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy” by 32 states, which has since grown to 54 endorsing states. This declaration, developed by the United States, is nonbinding and aims to foster consensus on norms for the military deployment of artificial intelligence (AI). This paper supports Canada’s leadership of the Accountability Working Group, one of three international working groups formed to elaborate on compliance with the declaration’s principles. It delves into the complex legal discourse surrounding accountability for AI actions in armed conflict, particularly focusing on lethal autonomous weapons systems and decision support systems used in targeting."},
{"title": "Closing the Global North-South Gap in the Second Space Age", "authors": ["Chaitanya Giri", "Kyle Hiebert"], "publishing_date": "2024-08-27T13:00:00Z", "abstract": "When the world entered the First Space Age in the 1950s, only a few developed economies pursued access to space for their geostrategic goals. Over time, the global space apparatus began providing space applications to developing economies, helping them raise their socio-political indicators. Today, many nations of the Global South have recognized the significance of access to space and are investing efforts towards pursuing it. However, there is a stark divide between current and developing space powers, with the current powers creating astropolitical blocs based on the geostrategic space race that has waxed and waned but never diminished. This bloc formation burdens the developing space-capable countries with the geostrategic aspirations of the bloc leaders. In light of the fast-paced changes that space commercialization is bringing about worldwide, a new set of outer space regulations are needed under the auspices of the United Nations to narrow this Global North-South divide and ensure that access to space is equitable and benefits the inherent needs of human development and Earth’s well-being."},
{"title": "International Norms Development and AI in the Military Domain", "authors": ["Tim Sweijs", "Sofia Romansky"], "publishing_date": "2024-09-04T17:00:00Z", "abstract": "The growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in military applications has changed the way countries engage in war and in times of peace. With so many potential effects of military AI applications, both positive and negative, there is growing demand for international norms to govern their responsible use based on ethical and legal principles. While some argue that current international and human rights laws are sufficient, this paper makes the case for expanding norms to encompass the rapid growth of military AI use while looking at the challenges facing international norms development, current initiatives, and strengths and weaknesses in the normative landscape."},

Its rollout over the coming decade could be a very big deal indeed. To achieve broad welfare gains and global participation in the AI economy, stakeholders — producers, suppliers, consumers, researchers, regulators and others — will need a safe and trustworthy business environment that facilitates responsible access and technology diffusion."},
{"title": "Competing Ideas: Canada’s Competition Reform Conversation", "authors": ["Vass Bednar", "Keldon Bester"], "publishing_date": "2024-04-29T14:00:00Z", "abstract": "The Government of Canada’s recent review of and updates to the Competition Act have sparked a closer examination of how competition is protected and promoted in Canada. Competition affects all Canadians, especially in the face of rising costs of living and a shrinking number of competitors in key markets. Yet the laws that govern competition are not easily understood by average consumers, leaving them out of the public policy conversation. This paper looks at why better competition law is needed and examines previous reform efforts."},
{"title": "Into Uncharted Waters: Trade Secrets Law in the AI Era", "authors": ["Burcu Kilic"], "publishing_date": "2024-05-16T13:00:00Z", "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has many beneficial applications that can improve quality of life, but accountability and transparency can be elusive when problems arise. This paper looks at the tools, systems and measures needed to ensure that when AI systems do more harm than good, their administrators are held accountable. Trade secrets law protects the source code, algorithms and data sets upon which AI systems are built, but they also prevent those harmed by these systems from getting answers. Requests for disclosure, data sharing and due process are being denied in the name of trade secrets protection. Complicating the matter is that trade secrets are treated differently in various jurisdictions."},
{"title": "Multi-stakeholder Data Access in Space-Based Climate Monitoring", "authors": ["Kathryn Urban"], "publishing_date": "2024-09-03T13:00:00Z", "abstract": "Data collected from satellite imagery and space-based instruments is essential to informing climate modelling. However, there is a fundamental tension between the public and private entities, who fund and maintain most of the data collection assets in orbit, and the civilian researchers, who seek to use that data to further our understanding of a changing climate. This paper puts forward a multi-stakeholder framework for climate data access, drawing out existing synergies across the public, private and scientific sectors to build on current climate data initiatives. This framework portends a leading role for defence actors owing to data requirements that mirror gaps in current researcher climate data access. The paper concludes with highlighting potential flashpoints in implementing the framework and makes recommendations for alleviating the concerns of key stakeholders."},
{"title": "Fair Competition for an Evolving Economy", "authors": ["Keldon Bester"], "publishing_date": "2023-09-28T13:00:00Z", "abstract": "Fair competition is essential to economic growth. Without it, corporate concentration takes over. Canada’s permissive merger law has allowed a small number of big corporations to dominate key sectors of the Canadian economy, resulting in limited consumer choice. Although Canada’s competition laws are currently under review, its global peers are taking steps to protect competition in their own economies. This paper recommends that Canada should focus on the role of fair competition in its competition law framework, specifically differentiating beneficial and harmful competition. Canada’s abuse of dominance provision protects against anti-competitive conduct, but it does little to protect new and emerging competitors. This paper suggests that Canada should look to international peers such as the European Union, Germany and the United States for cues to reform its own system."},
{"title": "Is CBDC Evolutionary or Revolutionary? What Economic History Can Teach Us", "authors": ["Pierre L. Siklos"], "publishing_date": "2023-10-11T13:00:00Z", "abstract": "Looking at six historical examples, this paper explores the relationship between technology and monetary arrangements in the context of central bank digital currency (CBDC). The Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdom, the greenbacks era in the United States and the end of private money in Canada are among the examples that illustrate the role of the private sector in the development of money, the role of governments in overseeing key functions of money and the impact of economic crises. The author sees CBDC as an evolution, not a revolution, of the monetary system that can co-exist with traditional currency by performing the same core functions of notes and coins."},
{"title": "State-Centric Data Governance in China", "authors": ["Alex He"], "publishing_date": "2023-09-14T13:00:00Z", "abstract": "China’s state-centric data governance regime has evolved into a framework characterized by the pursuit of a dual goal to bolster both economic growth and national security at the expense of personal information protection, which is significantly compromised due to the government’s mostly unfettered access to personal data. This paper examines three components of data governance in China and then considers data governance institutions in the country. It describes how digital platform governance and regulation on cross-border data flows have illustrated the country’s dual goal. The paper concludes with a discussion of the global implications of China’s data governance system."},
{"title": "Missing Persons: The Case of National AI Strategies", "authors": ["Susan Ariel Aaronson", "Adam Zable"], "publishing_date": "2023-09-21T13:00:00Z", "abstract": "Policy makers should inform, consult and involve citizens as part of their efforts to data-driven technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). Although many users rely on AI systems, they do not understand how these systems use their data to make predictions and recommendations that can affect their daily lives. Over time, if they see their data being misused, users may learn to distrust both the systems and how policy makers regulate them. This paper examines whether officials informed and consulted their citizens as they developed a key aspect of AI policy — national AI strategies. Building on a data set of 68 countries and the European Union, the authors used qualitative methods to examine whether, how and when governments engaged with their citizens on their AI strategies and whether they were responsive to public comment, concluding that policy makers are missing an opportunity to build trust in AI by not using this process to involve a broader cross-section of their constituents."},
{"title": "Clearing the Fog: The Grey Zones of Space Governance", "authors": ["Jessica West", "Jordan Miller"], "publishing_date": "2023-11-30T14:00:00Z", "abstract": "Building on earlier research published by CIGI on the space-cyber nexus, the authors find that there is not one “grey zone” in space governance, but a cluster of nebulous governance challenges that are set to grow as our use of outer space not only expands but evolves in unexpected ways. The ultimate challenge, then, is to colour in governance frameworks so that less grey — less ambiguity — remains. In this paper, the authors peel back the layers of opacity that shroud the grey zone to reveal some of these unsettled governance issues that give rise to it, expand its scope and result in hidden harms. The analysis flows from the military concept of grey zone tactics to an identification of three entangled governance challenges. Stronger governance measures are needed, and the paper concludes by outlining opportunities for providing some colour in the grey zones of space governance by clarifying the parameters and rules of peaceful uses of outer space, making space activities and their potential harms more visible, and pursuing cross-domain governance discussions."},
{"title": "The Governance Gap: Preparing Professions for Digital Transformation", "authors": ["Sean Martin McDonald", "Ben Gansky"], "publishing_date": "2023-11-27T14:00:00Z", "abstract": "How do professional governance organizations teach their members, such as those who work in health care, law or urban planning, how to navigate digital transformation in their fields of practice? This paper looks at the governance gap created by the increasing role of digital technology in regulated professions, the participation process for setting professional standards and the education infrastructure to teach new professionals how to navigate both. The authors’ recommendations focus on the role of professional education programs (degree-granting programs that train students to become a certified professional). The authors argue that bridging the gap between digitally transformed professional practice and professional governance will require training new professionals to do so."},
{"title": "Could a Global “Wicked Problems Agency” Incentivize Data Sharing?", "authors": ["Susan Ariel Aaronson"], "publishing_date": "2023-03-27T13:00:00Z", "abstract": "Global data sharing could help solve “wicked” problems (problems such as climate change, terrorism and global poverty that no one knows how to solve without creating further problems). There is no one or best way to address wicked problems because they have many different causes and manifest in different contexts. By mixing vast troves of data, policy makers and researchers may find new insights and strategies to address these complex problems. National and international government agencies and large corporations generally control the use of such data, and the world has made little progress in encouraging cross-sectoral and international data sharing. This paper proposes a new international cloud-based organization, the \"Wicked Problems Agency,\" to catalyze both data sharing and data analysis in the interest of mitigating wicked problems. This organization would work to prod societal entities — firms, individuals, civil society groups and governments — to share and analyze various types of data. The Wicked Problems Agency could provide a practical example of how data sharing can yield both economic and public good benefits."},
{"title": "Sino-Russian Relations: The Implications of Putin’s Strategic Folly", "authors": ["Kurtis H. Simpson"], "publishing_date": "2023-12-07T14:00:00Z", "abstract": "Sino-Russian relations have changed dramatically over the past decade, especially following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, and its ongoing occupation. The success of Canada’s national Indo-Pacific strategy depends on a comprehensive understanding of China, Russia and the ties that bind these strategic partners. Their relationship has not always been smooth, fluctuating from shared ideologies, mutual aid and support to deep divisions and open conflict. Their Cold War-era rivalry evolved into a more balanced partnership after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 as they joined forces to counter US global dominance. But the ties between the two countries began to unravel following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine, isolating Russia economically and diplomatically and undermining its military power to the point where China now considers it “a junior partner.”"},

An interplanetary or solar-system internet will require a governance system that can manage the economic, political and social issues that may arise. To address these issues, internet governance will need multi-stakeholder participation from traditional governments, international organizations and the private sector. This paper looks at the challenges facing the development of a space-based internet architecture and how existing UN space governance treaties and terrestrial internet governance could help mitigate these risks."},

The survey looked at the prevalence of online gender-based violence in 18 countries worldwide, with a special focus on the Global South. Other studies and literature referring to gender, sexuality and race are used to complement, contextualize and interpret the country-based data for Brazil. Brazilian respondents, particularly women and LGBTQ+ individuals, reported heightened negative effects on mental health, and low trust in or resort to law enforcement and other institutions. The experiences of high-profile individuals — 83 percent reported experiencing some type of online harm (connected to the very pressing issue of political violence in Brazil) — and the issue of image-based abuse are also discussed. The paper concludes with recommendations addressing some of the gaps concerning the public sector, the private sector, and the cultural or public debate in the response to tackling technology-facilitated gender-based violence in Brazil and globally."},

In the face of a rapidly evolving digital era, international cooperation will be critical to ensuring peace and security. Information sharing, expert conferences and multilateral dialogue can help the world’s nation-states and their militaries develop a better understanding of one another’s capabilities and intentions. As a global middle power, Canada could be a major partner in driving this effort. This paper explores the development of military-specific capabilities in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Building on Canadian defence policy, the paper outlines the military applications of AI and the resources needed to manage next-generation military operations, including multilateral engagement and technology governance."},

This paper examines these visions and strategies to better understand what policy makers hope to achieve. Data is different from other inputs: it is plentiful, easy to use and can be utilized and shared by many different people without being used up. Moreover, data can be simultaneously a commercial asset and a public good. Various types of data can be analyzed to create new products and services or to mitigate complex “wicked” problems that transcend generations and nations (a public good function). However, an economy built on data analysis also brings problems — firms and governments can manipulate or misuse personal data, and in so doing undermine human autonomy and human rights. Given the complicated nature of data and its various types (for example, personal, proprietary, public, and so on), a growing number of governments have decided to outline how they see data’s role in the economy and polity. While it is too early to evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies, policy makers increasingly recognize that if they want to build their country’s future on data, they must also focus on trust."},

The best place to begin is with a full realization of the negotiated balance between exclusivity and access in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement). There is the need to turn the “TRIPS-past” of WTO IP rules agreed in 1995 into the “TRIPS-plus” of improved rules more fit to purpose for the twenty-first century. New rules are needed to help spark new innovations of all kinds and the rapid spread of those innovations worldwide, including rules relating to intangible assets and especially to digital expressions of IP. Continuing questions over the extent to which the TRIPS Agreement protects the exclusivity of IP rights in COVID-19 vaccines underscore how much uncertainty remains about where the line of this balance is in this multilateral trade agreement, and also how much doubt still exists about whether that line is in the right place."},

Its utility, however, may erode when geopolitics rather than economics becomes the primary objective. This paper examines the implementation problems and the unintended consequences of a new supply chain doctrine in the service of geopolitics, with a focus on US President Joe Biden’s Executive Order on America’s Supply Chains to protect US technological leadership and national security against China. With semiconductors as a primary target, America’s supply chain controls are designed to exploit China’s most glaring weaknesses as supply chain chokepoints that the US Commerce Department can block, thus impeding timely and cost-effective access to essential products, services and technologies. The paper also highlights a second defining characteristic of America’s supply chain doctrine — regulatory supply chain controls are combined with a big push in domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Three propositions are presented as guideposts for further research. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the implications for future US supply chain control against China: Will the quest for improved supply chain resilience succeed in mobilizing enough forces to shift the focus of US policy away from supply chain regulation in the service of geopolitics?"},

The anonymity of the system gives rise to emergent use as a host of terrorist sites, gun marketplaces, drug bazaars, malicious software fora and pernicious child abuse content boards. Law enforcement can effectively police the dark web through a number of techniques, but the most technologically intensive approaches — known more euphemistically as “network investigative techniques”— raise a number of legal quandaries as their use collides with long-standing legal principles in liberal democratic regimes. Finding ways to minimize the excesses of the dark web through active law enforcement engagement, while also preserving the legal bedrock of liberal democratic societies, is key. The authors explore these issues using the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s 2015 closure of the darknet Playpen child pornography site as a case study."},

Survey data reveals that users are also anxious about online harassment, malware, censorship and disinformation. The paper focuses on three such problems, specifically, internet shutdowns, censorship and ransomware (a form of malware), each of which can distort trade and make users feel less secure online. Finally, the author concludes that trade policy makers will need to rethink how they involve the broad public in digital trade policy making if they want digital trade agreements to facilitate trust."},

Victim-survivors have little recourse against the many forms of online gender-based violence, including threats of harm, some of which have been carried out. The resulting mental and physical health effects of TFGBV, among other impacts, have forced many victim-survivors out of online spaces and silenced their voices."},
{"title": "A Canadian Framework for Data Reuse", "authors": ["Michel Girard"], "publishing_date": "2021-04-26T13:00:50Z", "abstract": "Although Canada is making progress in protecting consumers against data misuse, it needs to turn its attention to enabling data reuse. The current practices and tools in place are not conducive for data sharing. This creates a significant hurdle for data scientists and statisticians as they cannot train algorithms without large data inputs. A national framework for data reuse is needed to manage risks associated with data sharing. It should include sector-based data strategies, the certification of new classes of data professionals across data value chains, common interoperability and governance standards, and a safe and secure data transmission infrastructure. As common data-sharing spaces are needed for data reuse to occur, there is an opportunity to experiment with different data-sharing models. A national data reuse framework is essential for Canada to assert its data sovereignty and become a digital society. This is why the federal government has a critical role to play."},

The disenfranchisement of displaced youth is a particular problem, because it further marginalizes young people who have already experienced persecution and been forcibly displaced. This paper aims to demonstrate the importance of including displaced youth in governance and decision making, to identify key barriers to engagement that displaced youth face, and to highlight effective strategies for engaging youth. Comprehensive financial, legal, social and governance reforms are needed in order to facilitate and support the meaningful engagement of youth in the refugee and IDP systems. Without these reforms and partnerships between youth and other diverse stakeholders, it will be difficult to achieve sustainable solutions for forcibly displaced populations and the communities that host them."},

Unfortunately, the oceans, generally, and the high seas, in particular, do not feature prominently in international climate mitigation or climate adaptation efforts. There are, however, signals that ocean conservation is poised to occupy a more significant role in international climate law and policy going forward. This paper argues that improved conservation and sustainable use of high-seas living marine resources are essential developments at the convergence of climate action and ocean governance that should manifest, at least in part, as climate-informed high-seas marine protected areas."},

China has proposed a series of new concepts and approaches on the issue of global governance, as well as an action plan for the next five to 10 years to push forward on reforming and strengthening the existing global governance institutions. China’s concepts of global governance are the community of shared human destiny; a new type of international relations; an international win-win partnership; and the principle of mutual consultation, co-building and sharing. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Belt and Road Initiative are the best examples of China’s proactive concepts and plans for global governance reform. The key to the success of China’s concept of global governance lies in managing US-China strategic competition and forming a consensus on international governance system reform. China’s global governance policy provides opportunities for Canada-China cooperation on reforming and strengthening international institutions."},

The key issues include Indigenous peoples’ full and effective participation in decision making in matters that affect them, the pursuit of culturally sensitive development policies, or what is now termed self-determined development, and effective monitoring or stock-taking mechanisms and processes, not only for planning but also for measuring progress. A combination of factors, including access to information and communications technology amid current Indigenous resurgence and rapidly intensifying Indigenous interest in data sovereignty, places Indigenous peoples in a strong position to further their ongoing investment not only in self-repositioning but also for practical realization of their rights to self-determination. "},

Randall Henning"], "publishing_date": "2019-07-22T13:58:51Z", "abstract": "The growth and proliferation of regional financial arrangements have substantially increased the complexity of the global financial safety net. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) often shares the task of fighting crises with such institutions. But, in addition to significant benefits, institutional overlap poses potential pitfalls that architects of financial governance should anticipate and avoid. This paper addresses seven such pitfalls, as they relate to competition, transparency, moral hazard, special-interest capture, secretariat autonomy, conflict resolution and creditor seniority. The paper also provides an update on regional arrangements in Europe, East Asia and Latin America, reviews their engagement with the IMF and offers recommendations for their further development. Critiquing official reports on financial governance, the paper concludes, among other things, that institutional competition, while harmful in program conditionality, can be beneficial in economic analysis and surveillance; regional arrangements should become more transparent; and the acuteness of moral hazard depends critically on institutional governance. Finally, because each affects the ability of others to carry out their tasks, these institutions should co-evolve."},

Haley"], "publishing_date": "2019-07-31T13:00:32Z", "abstract": "This paper discusses the nexus between the Donald Trump administration’s trade policy and International Monetary Fund (IMF) exchange rate surveillance. It reviews the evolution of IMF surveillance and the possible implications of incorporating currency manipulation clauses into bilateral trade agreements. Such clauses constitute a key US trade negotiation objective. While they may reflect genuine concern over practices to thwart international adjustment, they could erode the effectiveness of the IMF at a time of transition and resulting tension in the global economy. Managing this tension calls for a cooperative approach to the issue of adjustment, one consistent with the fundamental mandate of the IMF. An approach based on indicators of reserve adequacy is proposed. Such a framework was briefly considered and dismissed almost 50 years ago, which was likewise a period of tension in trade and global monetary affairs. Prospects for success today are equally dim because cooperative measures to assuage adjustment challenges would require repudiation of the view that exchange rate surveillance is about bilateral trade balances and abandonment of the zero-sum game approach to international arrangements on which Trump administration trade actions are based."},

Complacency is guaranteed to further exacerbate threats on safety and security, fundamental human rights, public institutions and democracy. It could result in engineering, infrastructure and/or public safety failures. If history in the deployment of disruptive technologies is any indication, taking a passive approach will ultimately result in state intervention and in a patchwork of regulations, rules, review and permitting programs, and, worse, unintended harm to people. Given the stakes, it will be important to set standards through open platforms in order to encourage broad participation and transparency in negotiated rulemaking in order to adapt to the cultures of communities of practices engaged in big data analytics and to generate a broad base of support and compliance."},

They extend the scope of patentability and provide additional rights to patent holders. This paper systematically maps these “TRIPS-plus” agreements. Exploiting a new data set, 52 TRIPS-plus agreements are found to have been concluded between 1990 and 2017. The major proponents of these TRIPS-plus agreements on patents are the United States, followed by the European Union and the European Free Trade Association. Other technology-rich countries, such as Japan and Korea, have surprisingly few TRIPS-plus provisions on patent protection in their trade agreements. Few South-South trade agreements include TRIPS-plus provisions, but some include TRIPS-extra provisions on genetic resources and traditional knowledge. Having a clear picture of these TRIPS-plus agreements is essential as they can have important social and economic consequences, including for the development of innovations and access to technologies."},

This paper discusses the different oversight options that are currently contemplated to ensure that parties act consistently with article 6.2 requirements and assesses their legal and political implications."},

Siklos", "Samantha St. Amand", "Joanna Wajda"], "publishing_date": "2018-11-28T14:00:33Z", "abstract": "Central banking has undergone significant changes in the past few decades. Central banks reinvented their policy communications strategies, while also championing economic and financial system stability in the aftermath of the 2007–2009 international financial crisis. These institutions are increasingly focused on improving public engagement to strengthen accountability and institutional reputations. Alongside these efforts is an important debate about what central bankers, as unelected technocrats, should be offering their views on in public fora. So far, discussions about the scope and content of central bankers’ speeches has remained largely anecdotal. This paper compares the speeches of the US Federal Reserve (the Fed) and the Bank of Canada (BoC) over the last two decades. Using a machine-learning algorithm, this paper provides empirical data upon which elected policy makers, central bank watchers and the public can assess the appropriate reach of central bankers’ public speaking engagements. The analysis suggests that the topics of central bankers’ speeches have not significantly widened in scope relative to their mandate documents. There are, however, noticeable increases over time in the discussion of some topics that may cause contention, such as education and inequality, by US Fed officials. Finally, despite a push to make central bank communication more accessible to a general audience, only six percent of BoC officials’ speeches and one percent of Fed officials’ speeches are accessible to individuals with high-school-level reading comprehension. There is no evidence that the linguistic complexity of central bankers’ speeches has simplified over time."},
{"title": "The Financial Sector and the SDGs: Interconnections and Future Directions", "authors": ["Olaf Weber"], "publishing_date": "2018-11-27T14:00:35Z", "abstract": "The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a recent framework that defines the main goals to achieve sustainable development until 2030. The SDGs combine major social and environmental goals to achieve sustainable development and address environmental issues much more prominently to protect the life-support systems necessary for sustainable development. Furthermore, they connect sustainable development and sustainable business issues, such as responsible production and consumption, while still promoting economic growth to create decent workplaces. It is estimated that $5 to $7 trillion will be needed annually until 2030 to achieve the SDGs. The World Bank estimated that domestic governments would provide between 50 and 80 percent of the funding for the SDGs and that the remaining funds should come from investors. Hence, the SDGs might be an opportunity for the financial industry to further establish sustainability principles and to engage in financing sustainable development. To engage the banking industry in financing the SDGs, this paper recommends that the banking industry enhance current financial sector codes of conduct by integrating the SDGs; align existing sustainable finance strategies with the SDGs; standardize SDG accounting and reporting to identify strengths and weaknesses of, as well as risk and opportunities for, the banking industry in addressing the SDGs; and develop innovative financial products that address the SDGs. Furthermore, it recommends that governments and financial regulators align financial regulation with sustainable development and the SDGs; offer financial mechanisms to mitigate financial risks in addressing the SDGs; and align development banks with the SDGs."},

This paper has aimed to address that gap by examining xenophobia in the context of refugees, first by considering definitions of xenophobia vis-à-vis other terms, including racism and nativism, and next by looking at the roots of xenophobia, which include not only political, social and economic grievances and uncertainty but also competition for scarce resources and the belief that one’s own nation-state or group is superior to others. The paper then reviews some expressions of xenophobic rhetoric and actions, and their impacts, before considering key issues and challenges in overcoming xenophobia."},

Siklos", "Samantha St. Amand"], "publishing_date": "2018-09-27T13:00:00Z", "abstract": "The global financial crisis put paid to the notion that financial shocks are benign most of the time and revived the idea that microprudential policies needed to be paired with macroprudential policies. These policy developments have been referred to as financial repression, in part because the pre-crisis belief that markets ought to be unfettered was being challenged. While restraints on the financial sector are largely welcome, it is worth considering whether the response to the fallout from the crisis is going too far. Arguably, lost in the discussion over financial reform is the need to balance the benefits and costs of financial liberalization versus financial repression. The paper highlights two weaknesses in current macroprudential policy strategies and presents some evidence of rising financial repression globally. First, a considerable emphasis has been placed on the content as opposed to the effectiveness of macroprudential frameworks. In addition, there is currently insufficient understanding of and experience with the global transmission of shocks that emanate from manipulating macroprudential instruments. Second, if macroprudential frameworks are increasingly used to reinforce economic sovereignty, this may threaten the transparency of the global financial system. Finally, empirical results that highlight the links between domestic institutions and the deployment of macroprudential instruments over the past decade are provided. Ultimately, the success and failure of any macroprudential framework must be evaluated by the strength and governance of domestic institutions that support its delivery."},

A number of points to guide the formation of industrial and innovation policy in the knowledge-based and data-driven digital economy are suggested. As part of their data strategies, countries should assess the market value of data generated in the exercise of public sector governance and data generated in Canadian public space; put in place procedures to capture data and regulate its capture; and use procurement to develop new capabilities in the private sector."},

The paper is motivated by the remarkably rapid mobilization of fiscal stimulus in the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, coordinated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which was followed by the equally remarkable rapid adoption of austerity in key advanced economies. This switch from stimulus to austerity occurred despite the languid pace of the global recovery, in which growth was, as subsequently described by IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde, “too low, for too long.” At the time, the change was justified in terms of concerns over large debt burdens and diminished capacity for future action. Curiously, however, the principled voices defending the interests of future generations were silent with respect to more recent tax cuts and the adoption of higher budgeted spending."},

Some observers expected the existing system of international financial regulation to be undermined by the larger number of players and their diverging interests from the traditional standard setters.

It finds that China has, by and large, been a “rule taker” so far, but points out some important signs of change. It argues that with improved technical capacity, greater stakes in international financial standards and rising structural power, China is poised to increase its participation in the making of international financial standards."},
{"title": "Central Bank Balance Sheets and the Interaction between Monetary Policy and Financial Stability", "authors": ["Idris Ademuyiwa", "Pierre L.

This paper explores this metric by examining the challenges of interpreting the conduct of monetary policy in recent years. It concludes that while the shift in emphasis toward the balance sheet of a central bank is understandable, it is a hazardous exercise, and this can lead some observers to exaggerate the significance attached to changes in balance sheet composition over time. Accounting standards differ greatly across countries, and the degree of transparency about balance sheet details also varies considerably in the more than 30 economies examined in this study. A global effort to improve the availability, timeliness and quality of central bank balance sheet data remains too much of a work in progress more than 10 years since the financial crisis erupted. Finally, as balance sheet interventions have also been used to address financial system stability concerns, the paper explores whether there is a trade-off between financial stability and the objectives of monetary policy. It finds that balance sheet expansions are associated with higher output volatility, and that central banks’ ability to minimize inflation and output variability may have been impaired by the pursuit of global financial stability conditions. These results suggest more, not less, global monetary and financial policy cooperation is needed to improve macroeconomic outcomes."},

Driven by skepticism about multilateralism and binding dispute settlement, and by a growing strategic and economic rivalry with China, the current US administration has elevated longstanding US concerns about WTO dispute settlement to new heights. The inability of WTO members to exercise their collective authority to interpret the meaning of their WTO commitments has meant that the Appellate Body is effectively not subject to any checks and balances. As other WTO members blocked US efforts to negotiate more member control, the United States increasingly turned to unpopular unilateral mechanisms, culminating in the current block on new appointments as part of its more disruptive trade policy."},

A general pluralization characterized this transformation, specifically professionalization, decentralization and formalization of procedures. A similar transition has subsequently occurred in the process of decision making in the areas of economic policy and foreign policy. The economic policy-making process demonstrates these new trends in China’s increasingly pluralized political economy. With China’s economy beginning to integrate into the global market since the reform and opening-up policy was initiated, a new dimension of globalization had been added"},
{"title": "Data Ownership", "authors": ["Teresa Scassa"], "publishing_date": "2018-09-04T12:48:19Z", "abstract": "The rapid expansion of the data economy raises serious questions about who “owns” data and what data “ownership” entails. In most jurisdictions, data that are kept confidential can be protected as confidential information. However, such data are vulnerable to exposure through hacking or leaking by third parties. In many instances, significant stores of data cannot be kept confidential, and protection must be sought elsewhere. Copyright law has long treated facts as being in the public domain, but will provide protection for compilations of facts that meet the threshold for “originality.” Such protection is considered to be “thin,” as it does not extend to the underlying facts, applying only to their original selection or arrangement. In the European Union, database rights offer a more robust protection for compilations of data, but they also fall short when it comes to protecting the facts that make up such compilations. "},
{"title": "Made in China 2025 as a Challenge in Global Trade Governance: Analysis and Recommendations", "authors": ["Anton Malkin"], "publishing_date": "2018-08-15T13:00:24Z", "abstract": "This paper provides a reassessment of Made in China 2025 (MIC 2025) — China’s industrial policy framework aimed at helping the country overcome the much-maligned middle-income trap — in the context of global trade governance. It suggests that China’s industrial policies have been viewed too narrowly — without sufficient attention to longer-term global governance issues — by a large segment of the global business and policy-making community. The paper argues that the general aims of MIC 2025 and the policies that underpin them are not unreasonable, given the increasingly prevalent dilemmas in global trade that China’s leaders are grappling with. These include problems of international development arising from growing global industrial concentration — driven by the growth of the intangible economy — and China’s shrinking access to importing and developing technological components (such as semiconductor chips) that are increasingly characterized as “dual-use” by China’s trading partners. This suggests that resolving the concerns of China’s trading partners regarding China’s industrial policies requires global trade governance reform to ensure an equitable, rules-based global trading order that addresses the legitimate needs of developing and middle-income economies in acquiring foreign-owned technological components and know-how, for the purposes of economic development. The paper concludes by outlining specific recommendations for Canada’s policy makers in improving their economic relationship with China in the context of MIC 2025."},

Beyond regulation, a suite of government policies, from economic development to infrastructure, inform and influence the defined or blurred line between market and state, including the values that are exerted in these policies. Open government data is a policy issue that sits in this context and straddles the dividing line between market and state. Consider open government data as data that the government publishes for anyone else to use. The core idea explored in this paper is whether human behavioural data may warrant exemption, for the time being, from publication by the government through its open data programs due to the potential for this data to be used to further commodify human behaviour."},

It draws from the literature on forced migration and other research to consider how these assessments are made and where further tools are needed to better measure the impacts of hosting refugees. Much of the literature reveals that refugees need not be the burden they are often portrayed to be. However, it is also true that states that host refugees are often the least able to offer protection and assistance to refugees and may not be in political contexts where it is easy to implement policies that could foster mutually beneficial situations for refugees and hosts. The paper therefore engages current literature to consider how to better facilitate responsibility sharing in order to mitigate the negative impacts of hosting refugees."},

This paper investigates the effect of macro uncertainty on research and development (R&D). Against that background, it discusses what the Group of Twenty (G20) and its member states can do in this regard to facilitate increased innovation. Using data on 30 countries covering 1982–2012, the relationship between fluctuations in macro uncertainty and R&D growth is studied. The analysis shows that increased macro uncertainty is associated with lower R&D growth, and that business enterprise expenditure on R&D (BERD) appears to be the leading culprit for lower expenditure during times of higher uncertainty. Regression analysis that accounts for potential endogeneity due to country-specific fixed effects further highlights that R&D may be less susceptible to some measures of uncertainty — such as cross-firm daily stock return spread, which may reflect the potential for higher than normal gains — and more susceptible to others — such as exchange rate daily volatility. In particular, R&D performed by industry does appear to suffer lower growth in the face of greater uncertainty, and there is no evidence that R&D financed by government is growing at a faster rate in such periods to combat the disincentives of investing under uncertainty. Several explanations and mitigating factors are discussed. The analysis underscores the importance for the G20 and its member countries to reduce uncertainty. One way of achieving this is by being clear in their intentions surrounding future policy and establishing effective, consistent and predictable patent regimes. The effect of uncertainty on innovation can be further minimized by pursuing R&D tax credit incentives and streamlining applicable government programs; during times of high uncertainty, a more aggressive innovation agenda should be pursued."},

The human struggle has long been to prove that it does not. Our tool in this struggle is the rule of law. Through the rule of law, right becomes might. Long a champion of the international rule of law, the United States of America, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, has now embraced the belief that might makes right, and is using its might to unmake right by assaulting the rule of law in world trade. Trump, and those who serve him, are taking illegal, unilateral actions and pursuing other trade policies that circumvent and threaten to undermine the rules-based world trading system. They are also engaged in a stealth war against the continued rule of law in the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement system through intimidation of those who serve at the apex of the system: the judges on the WTO Appellate Body. The other members of the WTO must not yield to the unilateral ultimatums of the Trump administration or to its actions of intimidation that threaten to halt WTO dispute settlement. In the near term, the other WTO members should circumvent the recalcitrance of the United States by using arbitration under article 25 of the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding as an alternative form of WTO dispute settlement. In the long term, they should eliminate the possibility of intimidation of WTO judges by the United States, or by any other country, by removing the design flaw of the possibility of reappointment to a second term for any member of the WTO Appellate Body. At the same time, the Appellate Body should be recast as a full-time, standing tribunal of judges who will serve longer single terms and will have the resources sufficient to improve the performance of the WTO dispute settlement system. These changes in the WTO in the near term and in the long term will prevent might from unmaking right in world trade."},

While these technologies are likely to boost productivity and generate significant wealth, their potential impact on the labour market is concerning, with some estimates suggesting that nearly half of all existing jobs could be automated in the next two decades. What is almost certain is that these technologies will further increase inequality: workers with skills that are complementary to these new technologies will benefit, while those with skills that are substitutes will face dimming job prospects. The extent and speed of the transformation remains uncertain. This paper presents several possible scenarios for the future of work and draws on the Industrial Revolution to offer a historical perspective. It ends with a discussion of different policy options that could be deployed. Foremost, it highlights the urgent need for further international collaboration to broaden the tax base, both because tax avoidance is likely to become a bigger problem as wealth and income become increasingly concentrated and mobile and because of the likely need to expand the social safety net in the face of potentially massive and long-lasting disruptions."},

The “Walloon CETA saga” that occurred during ratification of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) in 2016, in which the Walloon Parliament initially blocked approval for Belgium to sign CETA, indicates that more attention is warranted as to how best to keep subnational interests represented as modern treaties increasingly affect the competences of such actors.

Canada was active in military prosecutions of war crimes immediately after World War II, but then entered a dormant period for three decades. In the 1980s, the Department of Justice made addressing the issue of the presence of Nazi war criminals in Canada a priority. For the next two decades, Canada’s domestic focus saw some successes and high-profile failures in the country’s attempts to enforce international criminal law norms. However, the creation of the international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda in 1993 and 1994, respectively, turned Canada’s focus to the international stage. Canada became a recognized world leader in the development of international criminal law in the drafting and adoption of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), as well as in the Rome Statute’s domestic implementation. Canada also played a crucial role in creating and sustaining other international criminal tribunals."},

Initially burdened by its status as a British colony, and later by the powerful economic and political influence of the United States, Canada had developed, by the mid-twentieth century, an independent voice on IP policy and asserted its own sovereign interest. It became a key middle-power leader in the movement toward the arranged marriage of IP and trade law, which ultimately resulted in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Now, with the apparent denouement of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, its possible resurrection as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (without the United States and its more excessive demands), the successful conclusion of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement and the renegotiation of NAFTA, Canada stands poised to once again play an influential and even key international role, while striving to act in its own best domestic interests."},

In previous work, Bronwyn Hall and Christian Helmers (2013) suggested that the patents pledged to the commons had the potential to encourage the diffusion of valuable environmentally friendly technologies.

In many ways, EU environmental law developed organically in areas where EU member states felt that common standards would be useful because differing standards would have a direct effect on the internal market. It is also one of the areas that was decisively shaped by the United Kingdom through the introduction into environmental legislation of market mechanisms previously unknown to the administrative legal systems of civil law that governed continental Europe. As such, this area is perhaps more difficult to negotiate because the expectation would be that the United Kingdom will still trade with the European Union, but perhaps intends to lower its own environmental standards, which would in turn give the United Kingdom a competitive advantage.

Data is the essential capital of this new economic age, as it enables the development of artificial intelligence, which drives the transformation of how technology transforms. The powerful network externalities and steep economies of scale and scope that characterize this new economic age raise economic governance concerns in terms of income distribution, corporate concentration and the ability of countries to participate and capture benefits. Meanwhile, the power implicit in access to and control of data raises a plethora of concerns over personal privacy, social manipulation, influence over elections and security. Since cross-border data flows are integral to international trade, trade agreements are entering into the regulation of data. However, as the world is only at the dawn of this new era, a legitimate question is whether the regulation of data is treaty-ready and what sorts of flexibilities need to be retained to enable appropriate policy responses as necessary. This paper argues that data is not treaty-ready and draws the conclusion that Canada, which has much at stake in claiming a role in the data-driven economy, should be cautious about entering into international commitments, the implications of which are as yet unclear."},
{"title": "Brexit and Human Rights", "authors": ["Colm O’Cinneide"], "publishing_date": "2018-02-22T19:56:49Z", "abstract": "Many commentators have expressed concern that the process of Brexit could have a negative impact on human rights protection in the United Kingdom. In contrast, others have argued that leaving the European Union offers an opportunity for the United Kingdom to develop better standards of rights protection than currently exist in UK or EU law, or at least standards that better reflect popular views in Britain about what qualifies as a human right. To assess the merit of these competing claims, it is necessary to consider whether Brexit creates a real risk that existing human rights standards may be eroded. In answering that question, it is clear that Brexit creates a risk that important EU legal standards that help to protect rights in areas such as personal privacy, workers’ rights and non-discrimination will be diluted, amended or even repealed over time. Furthermore, migrants and other vulnerable groups are most at risk from any such erosion of existing standards. This risk may never materialize. However, care needs to be taken that Brexit will not lead to a diluted respect for human rights. Human rights activists, and indeed anyone concerned with the protection of civil liberties and fundamental rights within UK law and policy, will need to be vigilant in the post-Brexit era."},

For patents, Brexit could lead the United Kingdom to diverge from EU principles on biotechnology and supplementary protection certificates, and also puts the United Kingdom’s role in the new Unified Patent Court system into doubt. In the area of copyright, the United Kingdom could use Brexit as an opportunity to move away from EU standards, including the key definitions of originality and parody. Ultimately, however, this paper argues that the slogan “take back control” is unlikely to lead to dramatic changes in the IP field. Both the European Union and the United Kingdom will likely seek to retain a great deal of regulatory convergence and cooperation over IP."},

These intangible capital stocks are not, however, represented in the workhorse models used to assess the impact of international trade agreements. As a result, it is not possible — using conventional tools — to evaluate the impact of treaty obligations in respect of IP protection, e-commerce and data; foreign direct investment in the knowledge-based sectors; and competition. Canada has recently implemented the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, is engaged in renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, and is in exploratory talks with China. The parties to these treaties dominate the knowledge-based and data-driven economy, yet none of these treaties/negotiations has been evaluated for its impact on Canada’s knowledge-based and data-driven economy, nor is it possible to show the treaties’ value in these areas of the twenty-first-century economy for the partner economies. This represents a serious gap in Canada’s ability to form evidence-based trade policy and to negotiate effectively. These considerations establish a prima facie case for urgent development of a quantitative framework to assess Canadian trade policies affecting the knowledge-based and data-driven economy.

After a brief overview of the current economic situation, the paper presents the core elements of a comprehensive international rescue effort, and explains why such a program is likely to produce financing needs that outstrip the resources available from the official community. Any program will require an urgent effort to address humanitarian needs as well as long-term financing, and there are important steps that can, and should, be done now to prepare. Given the scale of the financing required in the medium term, an ambitious adjustment program backed by generous financing and debt relief is needed to get Venezuela back on its feet. It is argued that reform and restructuring need to go hand-in-hand. Any restructuring or debt swapping provides only transitory relief and is unlikely to attract broad political support unless accompanied by a radical reform effort, a program that the current government is unlikely to be willing to consider. But it is not too early to begin planning for the day a new government comes to power that commands strong international support. It is further argued that the success or failure of any restructuring deal will depend on a number of policy and design choices, including the IMF’s conditions for lending, and the use of legal innovations and economic incentives to encourage creditor participation in any deal. This effort will be precedential for debt markets, involve extraordinary international cooperation, and potentially be consequential for a new US administration that, in public statements, has signalled a willingness to challenge accepted norms and rules for international policy coordination."},

Both areas are deemed to be profoundly affected by the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, since they have been substantially Europeanized. The European Union created unitary rights in both areas of law that would cease to extend to the United Kingdom after it leaves the European Union. In addition, the national laws on trademarks and designs in EU member states have been harmonized by European legislation. The United Kingdom may diverge from this common approach post-Brexit, but this depends heavily on the specific shape that Brexit may eventually take. Finally, the paper will discuss the effects of Brexit on the laws of geographical indications, the doctrine of exhaustion and the interface of intellectual property and competition law. Since they derive from EU legislation or case law, the specific shape of Brexit will define their fate in UK law."},

Setser"], "publishing_date": "2017-09-28T13:06:42Z", "abstract": "The damage from Hurricane Maria may push Puerto Rico into a worst-case scenario of accelerating decline and ever-falling tax revenues if the loss of housing and a sustained power failure lead to large-scale outmigration. Given the need to alleviate immediate suffering, the potential loss of near-term tax revenues and the risk to medium-term stability, the federal government should assure adequate access to emergency funding and the Financial Oversight and Management Board, for its part, should be prepared to make appropriate adjustments to the fiscal plan. Even before the hurricane, Puerto Rico was in the midst of a deep fiscal, economic and social crisis. This paper provides a critical review of Puerto Rico’s fiscal and economic plan, with analysis that was carried out prior to Hurricane Maria. It starts with an overview of the fiscal plan and the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), the federal law put in place in June 2016 to support Puerto Rico’s recovery. The second section reviews Puerto Rico’s historical population trajectory and economic trends to highlight the depth of the challenges faced by policy makers in trying to fix the territory. The third section highlights the substantial downside risks to Puerto Rico’s fiscal and economic plan. Finally, since it is expected that Puerto Rico’s recovery will be a work in progress for some time, the paper closes by suggesting that readers carefully track a few selected statistical measures for signs of further trouble."},

Some of these provisions now relate to precise environmental issues, such as biodiversity or hazardous waste management.

{"title": "Intellectual Property in a Renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement: A Canadian Perspective", "authors": ["Ton Zuijdwijk "], "publishing_date": "2017-08-14T21:29:44Z", "abstract": "Consistent with promises made in the 2016 presidential campaign, the Trump administration requested a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This paper focuses on the NAFTA intellectual property (IP) chapter and situates the NAFTA renegotiation in the context of Canada’s other recent trade agreement negotiations with significant IP components: the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) and the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement. The upcoming review of the NAFTA IP chapter will provide an opportunity to address issues of alignment of the NAFTA IP chapter and the World Trade Organization’s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. Canadian negotiators will want to be vigilant to avoid conflicts between any new NAFTA provisions derived from the TPP, on the one hand, and Canada’s CETA obligations, on the other. This is particularly pertinent in the area of geographical indications in respect of agricultural products and foods and the area of supplementary protection certificates in respect of pharmaceutical patents (which Canada will introduce to comply with its new CETA obligations)."},
{"title": "How Has Canadian Manufacturing Fared under NAFTA? A Look at the Auto Assembly and Parts Industry", "authors": ["Jeff Rubin"], "publishing_date": "2017-08-08T13:25:19Z", "abstract": "Under duty-free trade provided by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), local vehicle assembly and parts jobs and production in both the United States and Canada have been traded to Mexico for higher industry profit margins and lower vehicle prices for North American consumers. US President Donald Trump has pledged to change that basic economic trade-off in favour of repatriating production and restoring the industry’s once sizeable economic footprint in the US economy through resurrecting trade barriers against soaring levels of vehicles and parts production from Mexico, where wages are much lower. While cross-border, value-added supply chains are often said to blur distinctions on where vehicles are actually made, trade, investment, production and employment data all point to a large-scale migration of the industry to Mexico over the last decade. By most industry metrics, Canada’s vehicle and parts industry has been as adversely impacted as that of the United States — and in some cases more so — by the shift in production to Mexico under NAFTA. With the Trump administration serving notice that it will be renegotiating NAFTA and specifically targeting Mexico’s burgeoning assembly and parts industries, what are the best trade policy options for Canada’s largest manufacturing sector and exporter?"},

The paper concludes that Brexit clearly represents a setback, as the United Kingdom has by far the deepest and most liquid capital markets in the European Union, but it also provides an opportunity to launch a more ambitious CMU agenda encompassing the remaining 27 EU members."},
{"title": "Southern Accents: The Voice of Developing Countries in International Financial Governance", "authors": ["James M. Boughton"], "publishing_date": "2017-08-30T13:45:00Z", "abstract": "When the modern international financial system (IFS) was created during World War II, it was designed largely, but not exclusively, by a few advanced and industrialized economies. Developing countries participated in and contributed marginally to the proceedings. Subsequently, especially in the 1960s, the dominant rich countries decided that running the system and shaping its evolution should be their responsibility alone. It then fell to the developing countries to try to regain a voice and to claw back a measure of influence. It has not been easy, and the successes have been few and mostly around the edges. Whether the IFS is guided by a small group of countries or is shaped by a more diverse and inclusive group is a matter of global importance. Although small and poor countries — while large in number — account for only a small portion of total cross-border financial flows, they have a strong stake in the outcome. In the aggregate, that stake has a potentially large global effect. If the system is unstable or volatile, or if financial flows contribute to the concentration of wealth in a few countries, or if small countries lack the ability to attract financial inflows to finance economic development, then the overall health of the world economy will be negatively impacted. Conceptually, a small self-selected steering committee could guide the system in a way that protects the interests of small and poor countries as well as their own. Nonetheless, a more inclusive process would make a globally beneficial outcome far more likely. This paper examines that process by which the developing countries have come together as a group to try to influence the evolution of the financial system. It then reviews some of the successes of that effort. The effort to regain and preserve influence and the reasons that it became increasingly difficult are then examined. The paper concludes with some reflections on the challenges going forward."},

How do Chinese think tanks compare with familiar models of think tanks in Western countries such as the United States and Canada? How do these Chinese characteristics affect the ability of Chinese think tanks to fulfill the mission set for them by China’s leaders? These are the questions explored in this paper. On balance, the Chinese characteristics of these think tanks — their relationship with the government and the way they carry out their functions — limit their effectiveness in improving policy making and increasing the country’s soft power. They may be a useful instrument for the party-state to guide public opinion in China for the time being, but that may not be a sustainable or a particularly valuable role for think tanks in the long run."},

In May 2017, members of the United Nations Working Group on Business and Human Rights will conduct a country visit to Canada. This paper will introduce the UNGPs, examine the experience of other countries visited by the working group, including the United States, which was visited in 2013, and consider what to expect during the visit to Canada. It is likely that the working group will consider implementation of the state duty to protect human rights in terms of its application both to businesses operating within Canada and to Canadian companies operating internationally. Given Canada’s prominence in global mining and ongoing contestation over respect for Indigenous rights within Canada, especially in the oil and gas sector, it is also likely that the working group will pay careful attention to implementation of law and policy in natural resource development. Following the country visit, the working group is likely to recommend that Canada develop a national action plan for the implementation of the UNGPs. This presents an opportunity for Canada to play a leading role in clarifying the link between business and human rights, Indigenous rights and climate change."},

It is, however, critical that energy development initiatives are linked to economic activity to stimulate socioeconomic development. This paper contributes to the discourse on global development through rural electrification by presenting cases on energy delivery for rural development in three developing countries on different continents. Specifically, this paper addresses the challenges around innovation in designing, financing and implementing sustainable business models necessary for delivering energy to rural communities in developing countries. The paper also highlights the importance of business models in attracting finance for rural renewable energy projects, establishes the importance of adapting business models to local conditions and specifies the role of innovation in scaling up sustainable business models to accelerate progress toward alleviating the energy access challenge in developing countries."},

This paper discusses the theoretical case for strong national patent regimes in the context of a globalized world. The national treatment of foreign inventors gives countries an incentive to free ride, and while this can be overcome through patent rights harmonization agreements, these present coordination challenges. In particular, while more innovative countries will benefit from harmonizing on a higher level of patent rights, less innovative countries will prefer a lower common level. These insights are applied to Canada, where both theory and empirical evidence suggest that Canada’s patent regime is doing little to promote domestic innovation, while generating significant deadweight losses for the economy. The conclusion is that Canada’s interests would best be served by a weaker national patent regime, subject to its current international obligations. Moreover, any future agreements that increase such obligations would "},
{"title": "Intellectual Property Proliferation: Strategic Roots and Strategic Responses", "authors": ["Dan Ciuriak"], "publishing_date": "2017-03-21T19:39:23Z", "abstract": "Intellectual property (IP) is essential for commercialization in the knowledge-based economy.  However, the creation of intellectual property rights (IPRs), which were originally developed for a world of sparse and sporadic invention, has led to potential stumbling blocks for industrialized research and development and continuous and massively parallel innovation. This potential has been actualized through the untrammelled proliferation of IPRs in recent decades. This paper argues that this proliferation has strategic roots at the national level, based on the potential to capture global rents through the internationalization of IPRs. In a rules-based system, a World Trade Organization agreement, championed by the United States and China, modelled conceptually on the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union, would establish disciplines on the creation of IP, provide for a timely retirement of non-performing IP (modelled on mutual tariff elimination under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and establish an international IP court for the adjudication of cross-border infringement claims. This would reduce innovation costs, in particular for start-ups, address the “tragedy of the anticommons” and contribute to the policy reforms required to address the “stag-deflation” to which IP proliferation has been a contributing factor."},

Specifically, the paper uses case studies of renewable energy programs in three different countries to examine financing possibilities and policy options for governments developing renewable energy programs. The renewable energy programs investigated in this study are the feed-in tariff program in Ontario, Canada, the clean energy auction program in Mexico and the renewable energy independent power producer procurement program in South Africa. While the three programs share a number of similarities, there are also some differences, in particular in the design of the renewable energy programs.              "},

What is sure, however, is that NAFTA is now more than 20 years old and, as a result, it would benefit from being modernized to reflect North America’s twenty-first-century economic reality of “making things together.” Relying in several instances on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between Canada and the European Union, and the now-suspended Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, this paper proposes changes and additions that should be part of an updated NAFTA. The focus is on the NAFTA elements that have been subject to criticism since the agreement’s entry into force. It offers a fairly detailed road map to the agreement’s modernization. This paper does not, however, provide a chapter-by-chapter, article-by-article review of NAFTA. Regardless of the rhetoric coming from the Trump administration, it is the authors’ view that Canada’s position should be to approach any NAFTA renegotiation from a “best case” perspective in view of making trade and investment in North America easier for business. Only in this way is Canada likely to get the best deal possible for its own economy, as well as for the American and Mexican economies."},

Yet, despite broad international consensus regarding the basic principles to limit the misuse of ICTs in the digital age and to constrain state behaviour, the key tenets have been consistently violated."},
{"title": "Sovereign Debt Restructuring: Bargaining for Resolution", "authors": ["James A. Haley"], "publishing_date": "2017-04-05T17:00:18Z", "abstract": "Sovereign debt restructurings can result in large deadweight losses to debtors and their creditors. This fact accounts for efforts to promote a better framework for the timely resolution of sovereign debt problems. Attention to date has largely focused on creditor coordination issues; in particular, addressing possible coordination failures that can result in protracted delays. This paper reviews these efforts and the steps taken to reduce the costs associated with coordination problems. The informational and commitment challenges that impede the resolution of debt disputes are also considered. These obstacles to efficient bargaining can lead to lengthy delays and increase deadweight losses. At the same time, asymmetric and incomplete information and the inability of sovereign debtors to commit to a flow of resources to debt service hinder efforts to resolve sovereign debt crises through the greater use of GDP-linked debt and debt buybacks. To assuage these effects, the possible use of debt guarantees to expedite restructurings is discussed. In this regard, the objective of a well-designed guarantee that aligns incentives and helps bridge the informational divide between debtor and creditors is to facilitate debt negotiations that result in a bargaining for resolution."},

The analysis reveals that the count of names of Canadian native inventors residing abroad exceeds that of Canadian immigrant inventors residing in Canada. This means either that Canadian firms are bringing in fewer patenting inventors than they are losing to foreign firms, or that Canadian inventors residing abroad submit relatively more Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications, or both. The rate of Canadian inventor-patent emigration, as measured by the share of Canadian non-resident inventors named in Canadian PCT applications, has risen quickly over time, with the United States being the major destination country; at the same time, the Canadian inventor-patent immigration rate has been rather stable and relatively low. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings and policy recommendations. The importance of building a sustainable, supportive climate for innovation is emphasized. A suitable innovation ecosystem would help Canada and Canadian firms to improve talent retention rates by providing a more attractive working environment."},

Such delays may stem from two sources: intra-creditor coordination failures; and factors that impede efficient bargaining between the debtor country and private creditors. These impediments to bargaining include asymmetric and incomplete information, as well as the inability of sovereign borrowers to credibly commit to a stream of debt service. A well-designed guarantee of restructured debt that addresses these problems in the context of debt restructuring operations designed to assure debt sustainability could promote timely restructuring and reduce the potential risks to the global economy associated with severe indebtedness."},

The paper creates a framework to navigate the dialogue surrounding critical infrastructure and the IoT, addressing the emerging risks to critical infrastructure with the rise of the IoT, and toward explaining cyber threats to business and governments in the face of an expanding IoT. Presenting an overview of the basics of IoT and the technical processes and issues raised by it, and through landmark examples and references, a set of recommendations to overcome these risks are presented to create an informational resource regarding this growing pertinent conversation in light of competing information and forecasts."},

These responses have fallen short of actual amendment of NAFTA, but they have changed the way investor-state arbitration (ISA) is being practised by taking significant steps toward more transparent procedures. Canada and the United States have also made significant strides toward responding to criticisms of the substantive standards of protection of foreign investors by changing the drafting of their respective model bilateral investment treaty or foreign investment protection agreement and by incorporating different formulations of these standards in subsequent trade and investment treaties such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. Canada’s acceptance in the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement of the European Union’s proposal for a standing tribunal to replace ad hoc arbitration constitutes another significant response to the critics of ISA."},

During the negotiations that led up to the signing of the Paris Agreement in December 2015, states included an explicit reference to human rights only in the preamble of the legal norm, negotiating other direct references to human rights out of operative provisions. The outcome of negotiations raised the question of whether states have missed an opportunity to positively and unquestionably secure a rights approach to climate action post-2020. Using a contextual analysis of other international law developments that occurred alongside the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015, especially the international agreement on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this paper argues that states have properly integrated a human rights dimension into key operative provisions of the Paris Agreement, albeit indirectly."},

Its central argument is that multi-stakeholderism is, as yet, a much less well-defined institutional form. Cases exhibit significant variation both in the combinations of actor classes entitled to participate and the nature of authority relations among those actors. The first section discusses multi-stakeholderism as an institutional form, and proposes a taxonomy of its types. This section also briefly addresses the implications of the analysis for international relations theory. The authors then conduct a comparative analysis of multi-stakeholderism, applying the taxonomy to five illustrative cases, demonstrating the degree of inter-case variation and range of issue-areas across which the institutional form is employed and invoked by actors. Three cases are drawn from the increasingly contentious area of Internet governance, thus making a secondary contribution to this growing literature. The paper’s most striking finding in this regard is that Internet governance often fails to live up to its multi-stakeholder rhetoric. Other cases include governance of securities regulation and the governance of corporate social responsibility. The paper concludes by examining the implications arguing multi-stakeholderism is a less defined institutional form, and identifying areas for further research."},

However, a few civil society groups had also raised broader sovereignty concerns in opposition to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Multilateral Agreement on Investment. Debates intensified from 2010, when Australia joined with the United States (and then 10 other Asia-Pacific economies) to negotiate the expanded TPP, and especially since 2011 when Philip Morris Asia launched the first-ever (and still pending) claim against Australia, regarding its tobacco plain packaging legislation, under a 1993 treaty with Hong Kong. As well as opposition to ISDS from the political left, economists in the Productivity Commission (PC) were skeptical in a 2010 report on FTA policy, which generally urged Australia to refocus on unilateral and multilateral liberalization initiatives. In 2011, the (centre-left) Gillard government Trade Policy Statement (TPS) largely accepted the commission’s recommendations, including eschewing ISDS in all future investment treaties — even with developing countries. Criticisms emerged, as major bilateral FTA negotiations stalled, and after the (centre-right) Coalition government gained power on September 7, 2013, it reverted to including ISDS on a case-by-case assessment (with bilateral FTAs then concluded with Korea and China, but not with Japan, as well as the regional TPP). However, the Greens Party in particular continued to object, initiating an “anti-ISDS bill” in the Senate in 2014. The committee recommended against enactment, but ISDS continues to be discussed in other parliamentary inquiries (into ratification of the Korea and China FTAs, Australia’s treaty-making process generally and the TPP). However, there has still been almost no sustained analysis of how Australia’s domestic law protections for (all) investors compare to substantive protections for foreign investors under international customary and treaty law."},

The full resolution of the sovereign default took almost 15 years. This paper examines the whole restructuring process. It describes the strategies followed by the debtor and the bondholders, the domestic economic implications of the restructuring and the characteristics of the legal disputes. It also analyzes the implications of the default resolution for the functioning of sovereign lending markets."},

Even more recently, the locus of concern has expanded to include the human rights implications of response measures to confronting climate change. The newly adopted Paris Agreement includes language that calls on its parties to consider, respect and promote the protection of human rights when taking actions to address climate change. However, the agreement fails to suggest specific means to operationalize this mandate."},
{"title": "Misperceptions, Threat Inflation and Mistrust in China-Japan Relations", "authors": ["Benoit Hardy-Chartrand"], "publishing_date": "2016-07-07T10:21:00Z", "abstract": "The period between 2012 and 2014 saw relations between East Asia’s two pre-eminent powers, China and Japan, reach their lowest point since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1972. An acrimonious territorial dispute in the East China Sea and differing perceptions of their shared history have been the primary drivers of tensions. The friction at the official level has also been reflected in public opinion, with mutual perceptions between the Japanese and Chinese populations reaching unprecedented levels of negativity in 2013 and 2014. Despite a relative thaw at the official level since the countries’ leaders met for the first time in November 2014, tensions have since remained high. The rhetoric of threat has permeated in the media and official discourse in both countries. Through an analysis of these discourses, this paper explores mutual perceptions in China and Japan and argues that each side systematically overestimates the level of threat that the other poses, with pernicious consequences for bilateral relations and regional stability."},
{"title": "One Internet: An Evidentiary Basis for Policy Making on Internet Universality and Fragmentation", "authors": ["Laura DeNardis"], "publishing_date": "2016-07-19T10:08:00Z", "abstract": "One twenty-first-century Internet policy debate concerns whether cyberspace will continue to expand into a universal network or fragment into disjointed segments based on geographical borders or proprietary ecosystems. Tensions between network universality and enclosure reflect conflicts among public-interest values in cyberspace. They also reflect increasing incongruity between the traditional governance roles of sovereign nation states and a global technological system that crosses national borders and is overseen by a distributed, private-sector-led multi-stakeholder governance framework. Under the mantle of cyber sovereignty, governments have attempted to overlay geopolitical borders on the Internet. New business models have raised questions about whether the next billion Internet users will have access to the global Internet or only a fraction of cyberspace available for free via walled gardens. This paper examines the extent to which the contemporary Internet can be viewed as a universal network now, explores the economic and social implications of emerging initiatives associated with the potential for Internet fragmentation, and presents a baseline proposal for the technological characteristics and policy frameworks necessary for affording the Internet with a sustained capacity for ongoing global growth and openness."},

All 22 arbitration claims against Canada were brought by US investors, making Canada the developed democracy most experienced with ISA. Overall, when examined carefully, this experience is not as negative as one might think. The aggregate value of the claims is US$8.1 billion, or 2.9 percent of all US investment in Canada, while total damages effectively awarded or agreed to in settlement so far is US$147.5 million, or a mere 0.05 percent of all US investment. Most claims concern federal measures as opposed to provincial ones and, unsurprisingly, the huge majority of them are targeted at environmental measures, with a smaller share involving state-owned enterprises and public services."},

The case of China’s negotiation in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) represents another."},
{"title": "Does Canadian Law Provide Remedies Equivalent to NAFTA Chapter 11 Arbitration?", "authors": ["Armand de Mestral", "Robin Morgan"], "publishing_date": "2016-05-27T15:06:00Z", "abstract": "It is often alleged that the provisions for investor-state arbitration (ISA) are not needed in international trade agreements to protect the interests of foreign investors in developed democracies because these countries possess well-established judicial systems where justice is given on an impartial basis by impartial judges. It is alleged that if foreign investors were to go to domestic courts, they would find all the remedies they require. To test this hypothesis, this paper looks at the situation in Canada. All 35 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) claims against Canada are considered with a view to determining whether Canadian courts would be empowered to award the same damages that might be awarded by an ad hoc arbitral tribunal, were the claimant to be successful. Somewhat surprisingly, damages fully equivalent to those that might be awarded by a NAFTA tribunal would be available in only four cases. In many other cases, only administrative law remedies and no damages would be available. In some cases, no remedy would be available at all. This is due, in part, to the absence of property and contract guarantees in the Constitution of Canada. The result might well be different in other developed democracies."},

East Asia presents a fundamental paradox for scholars of international relations. It has arguably more sources of interstate tension than any other region of the developing world. However, it has experienced no significant interstate conflict since the end of the China-Vietnam war in 1979. After briefly reviewing the principal security challenges that East Asia faces, the paper then looks at the three categories of explanations for the long peace in the region: hegemony and balancing; institutions and elite socialization; and economic interdependence."},

Others argue that it may be needed in IIAs between developed nations that are mostly capital exporters, on the one hand, and developing countries that require foreign capital to promote development, on the other, but that it is unwarranted in IIAs that developed countries enter into among themselves. They reason that developed countries have robust legal frameworks and institutions, including responsive judiciaries, that adequately protect private investment and, therefore, ISA can safely be omitted from such IIAs without any detriment to foreign investors or their investments."},
{"title": "Patents and Internet Standards", "authors": ["Jorge Contreras"], "publishing_date": "2016-04-15T11:34:00Z", "abstract": "In recent years, high-profile lawsuits involving standard-sessential patents (SEPs) have made headlines in the United States, Europe and Asia, leading to a heated public debate regarding the role and impact of patents covering key interoperability standards. Enforcement agencies around the world have investigated and prosecuted alleged violations of competition law and private licensing commitments in connection with SEPs. A review of case statistics shows that patent filing and assertion activity is substantially lower for Internet-related standards than for standards relating to telecommunications and other computing technologies. This paper analyzes historical and social factors that may have contributed to this divergence, focusing on the two principal Internet standards bodies: the Internet Engineering Task Force and the World Wide Web Consortium. It offers a counternarrative to the dominant account portraying standards and SEPs as necessarily fraught with litigation and thereby in need of radical systemic change. Instead, it shows how standards policies that de-emphasize patent monetization have led to lower levels of disputes and litigation. It concludes by placing recent discussions of patenting and standards within the broader context of openness in network technologies and urges both industry participants and policy makers to look to the success of Internet standardization in a patent-light environment when considering the adoption of future rules and policies."},

Until the beginning of the new millennium, private capital flows to EMEs were mainly intermediated by large global banks, and EMEs were subjected to massive volatility in their external payments balances, exchange rates and domestic financial systems. But since the early 2000s, the role of bank-intermediated credit has declined, as the base of investors willing to take on exposure to EM corporate debt has become much larger and more diverse. These structural changes have encouraged a vast growth in flows of funds, not only from the mature economies to EMEs as a group, but also among EMEs themselves."},

The perspective offers little recognition of the current problems facing the country’s largest energy resource, and even less recognition of the problems that the oil sands will encounter as a result of actions taken by other countries to limit their own carbon emissions as pledged recently at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. As climate change compels deep decarbonization of the global economy, emission restrictions around the world will destroy demand for billions of barrels of oil over the coming decades, severely impairing the economic viability of high-cost producers."},

It discusses a variety of perspectives and trends, arguing that the future of education should be part of the global debate on Internet governance. It posits that Internet governance offers a new form of legitimacy for children and young people to go beyond their current “protected” status. A digital transition from education 2.0 (where information and communication technology are support tools) to education 3.0 (where media and information literacy and Internet governance are the new basics) can provide children with competencies for cooperation, creativity and social innovation. It can also nurture their human rights and understanding of shared values, which, in turn, will help to build more inclusive societies. The paper also considers the risks of inaction in the transition to education 3.0, drawing attention to a crucial element for effective change: the need to raise awareness and to support teachers, students and public authorities alike to embrace the notion of education 3.0, to consider the tools and resources needed and to engage in the phased adjustments needed at all levels of its governance. Ten recommendations are put forward, including the creation of the position of UN Special Rapporteur on education 3.0 for children and young people’s sustainable digital development, which could help to coordinate and promote coherent and dynamic engagement of all stakeholders."},
{"title": "The Privatization of Human Rights: Illusions of Consent, Automation and Neutrality", "authors": ["Emily Taylor"], "publishing_date": "2016-01-26T11:37:00Z", "abstract": "The Internet enables the free flow of information on an unprecedented scale but to an increasing extent the management of individuals’ fundamental rights, such as privacy and the mediation of free expression, is being left in the hands of private actors. The popularity of a few web platforms across the globe confers on the providers both great power and heavy responsibilities. Free-to-use web platforms are founded on the sale of user data, and the standard terms give providers rights to intrude on every aspect of a user’s online life, while giving users the Hobson’s choice of either agreeing to those terms or not using the platform (the illusion of consent). Meanwhile, the same companies are steadily assuming responsibility for monitoring and censoring harmful content, either as a self-regulatory response to prevent conflicts with national regulatory environments, or to address inaction by states, which bear primary duty for upholding human rights. There is an underlying tension for those companies between self-regulation, on the one hand, and being held accountable for rights violations by states, on the other hand. The incongruity of this position might explain the secrecy surrounding the human systems that companies have developed to monitor content (the illusion of automation). Psychological experiments and opaque algorithms for defining what search results or friends’ updates users see highlight the power of today’s providers over their publics (the illusion of neutrality). Solutions could include provision of paid alternatives, more sophisticated definition and handling of different types of data — public, private, ephemeral, lasting — and the cooperation of all stakeholders in arriving at realistic and robust processes for content moderation that comply with the rule of law."},

Milk, the United States and International Trade Negotiations", "authors": ["Bruce Muirhead"], "publishing_date": "2015-12-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract": "The United States has a history of dairy subsidies, going back to the 1930s. Since World War II, the country has also attempted to impose its vision of trade liberalization upon a suspicious world, sometimes in concert with what is now the European Union and sometimes on its own. This background paper explores the historical evolution of US trade policy as seen through its negotiations on the dairy file in international trade negotiations, largely sponsored by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and, after 1995, by the World Trade Organization. In these multilateral discussions, issues of agricultural protectionism and exceptionalism were addressed. It was not until the Uruguay Round (1986–1993), however, that agriculture was included in these negotiations, as neither the European Union (and its antecedents) nor the United States demonstrated any interest. While Uruguay was a tentative beginning, the subsequent Doha Round has dissolved over agricultural problems."},

In this particular instance, these sub-federal actors had a seat at the negotiating table at the request of their European Union partners. However, this paper argues that CETA is exceptional in this regard. Despite the fact that regional trade agreements increasingly contain provisions that relate to areas of provincial and territorial jurisdiction, each trade negotiation is distinct. The CETA experience should not create the expectation that provinces and territories will always participate in the same capacity. Any enhanced role will depend on the federal government’s strategic assessment of any specific trade negotiation."},

Existing attempts to address protracted situations for refugees engage with the concept and practices of the Self-reliance Strategy (SRS). This paper focuses on the SRS in Uganda’s Nakivale Refugee Settlement. It draws attention to its disconnection from the social and economic relations within which refugees live in settlements, and the strategy’s inability to provide refugees with sufficient access to social support and protection. In this context, the analysis highlights the failures of the SRS in terms both of shaping the conditions under which refugees experience restricted movement, social divisions and inadequate protection, and of placing greater responsibility on refugees for meeting their own needs with little or no humanitarian and state support. It also reveals how humanitarian and state actors, and their forms of assistance, manage the lives of refugees and are implicated in the creation of new challenges for refugees in Nakivale. In light of these issues, the paper emphasizes the gaps in the SRS orientation and calls for alternative approaches to humanitarian and refugee management that enable and support refugees to self-settle, access legal and social support, and participate in and contribute to their social and economic environment in meaningful and sustainable ways."},

Typically, when children are acknowledged it is in the context of child protection while their rights to provision and participation are overlooked. This paper specifically argues against an age-generic (or “age-blind”) approach to “users,” because children have specific needs and rights that are not met by governance regimes designed for “everyone.” In addition to addressing issues of child protection in the online space, policy and governance should now ensure children’s rights to access and use digital media and consider how the deployment of the Internet by wider society can enhance children’s rights across the board. As Internet use rises in developing countries, international Internet governance organizations face a key challenge in shaping, through multi-stakeholder processes, the emerging models of best practice that will underpin the development of positive norms recognized by states, parents and other relevant parties. The paper ends with six conclusions and recommendations about how to embed recognition of children’s rights in the activities and policies of international Internet governance institutions."},

Several pioneering financial institutions, some with the collaboration of non-governmental organizations, have developed key initiatives to act as a road map toward ensuring intra- and intergenerational equity. These initiatives are referred to as codes of conduct, and take on the name “voluntary,” because organizations are not mandated to adopt them. Nonetheless, these self-regulatory codes sometimes act as “soft” laws that are quasi-legal documents, but without any binding force other than benefits for the signatory. signatory. Codes that fall within the purview of this research include the United Nations Environment Programme Financial Initiative, the Equator Principles, the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment, the Global Alliance on Banking Values and the Impact Reporting and Investment Standards. Despite being formulated as tools to combat sustainability challenges, research suggests that adoption of these codes can be largely attributed to financial risk management and enhancing reputation. This paper discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the financial sector voluntary sustainability codes of conduct. It concludes that enforcement of the codes of conduct is a major issue, that they mainly focus on the business case of sustainability, rather than the impact on sustainable development, and that the codes of conduct are compromises that each financial institution can agree to without changing their business to move in a more sustainable direction."},

This shift is unprecedented among the large and increasing number of technocratic regimes essential to contemporary global governance, and is of broader interest and significance beyond Internet governance scholars and practitioners. This paper draws on international relations theory to argue that the emergence of contention in Internet governance entails a twofold shift in the nature of the problems posed by Internet governance: first, cooperation problems have emerged where few previously existed; and second, existing coordination problems have become increasingly difficult to manage as a result of a rapidly increasing number of players and heightened distributional consequences. This paper provides four complementary explanations for the shift in the underlying problem structure: extrinsic uncertainty, changing market conditions, declining US dominance in the Internet governance system and social processes of institutional change and regime complex formation."},

However, in recent years, many countries have issued data location rules restricting how corporations can handle and transmit their customers’ data across borders, including through these private networks. The implications of this new wave of data location regulation are particularly significant for banking. The financial industry has historically been heavily regulated in many ways, such as products offered or capital requirements. As more banking activities, such as data management, come under regulatory scrutiny, the effects are uncertain, but seem likely to be material. In order to provide a context for discussions of governance of the Internet and cyberspace more broadly, executives at a dozen global financial institutions were interviewed and asked about how this complex regulatory environment is affecting financial organizations. The interviews revealed several implications for banks and, more broadly, markets for financial services. For policy makers, understanding the impact on consumers and, where possible, mandating outcomes rather than specific technology configurations, can avoid or limit any unintended consequences for consumers’ access to financial services."},

This paper reviews three of the assumptions that underlie the analysis of what conflicts are about as they relate to Africa. These assumptions are: that conflicts result from zero-sum power politics among contending leaders; they are due to state weakness and the failure of governments to provide basic services and security; or they result from sharply differing views of culture and society."},

This paper seeks to fill in this gap by examining opportunities for China’s RTAs. It begins by highlighting the severity of China’s AD problems, notes the high concentration of AD actions taken by the top four and top eight AD initiators against China, and argues that AD issues should be given more weight in China’s RTA strategies. "},

Focusing on the challenges that have followed the contours of East Africa’s distinctive digital cultures, it challenges the view that cyber security and cyber resilience are simply technical problems that can be solved by reducing the gap with more technically advanced nations. On the contrary, it shows how cyber security is an inherently political challenge and that, in the absence of adequate checks and balances, the increasing securitization of domestic and international politics may require costly trade-offs with individual and collective freedoms."},
{"title": "The Environmental Goods Agreement: A Piece of the Puzzle", "authors": ["Patricia Goff"], "publishing_date": "2015-06-08T10:31:00Z", "abstract": "Can a trade agreement help achieve environmental goals? The answer to this question has traditionally been mixed, even skeptical. For example, despite the novelty of the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation side agreement approach, many were disappointed with the shallow and rather vague outcome. The World Trade Organization’s Doha Round negotiations were ostensibly committed to certain issues at the intersection of trade and environment, but multilateral talks have long been stalled. Despite these underwhelming results in other trade negotiations, the Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA) has the potential to produce a more positive outcome. This paper explores this potential, reviewing key aspects of the trade-environment relationship. Prevailing perceptions tend not to count trade agreements as key contributors to the achievement of environmental goals. The paper then looks at the potential contribution of tariff reduction to environmental objectives, and then examines critical challenges to the completion of EGA negotiations. It concludes that the EGA is an important piece of a complex environmental governance puzzle. "},
{"title": "Central Banks Can and Should Do Their Part in Funding Sustainability", "authors": ["Andrew Sheng"], "publishing_date": "2015-06-10T09:48:00Z", "abstract": "Central banks, when purchasing financial assets, should consider selecting assets that will promote sustainability, including climate change mitigation and adaptation. During the 2008 financial crisis, central banks deployed unconventional means to rescue failing banks and insulate economies from depression. Their asset purchases have had strong social impacts, but traditionally, central banks have not explicitly factored social objectives into their decisions or evaluated their impacts beyond the narrow monetary domain. Social impact investing is consistent with a central bank’s mandate to maintain price stability, but those not yet ready to move in this direction should at least incentivize bankers and asset managers to invest in, or lend to, climate mitigation activities and low-emission growth, as well as support a financial transaction tax."},

The proposals include: increasing the role of debt reprofiling in certain circumstances; introducing state-contingent debt such as GDP-linked bonds; creating a Sovereign Debt Forum to facilitate debtor-creditor cooperation and preserve best practices; strengthening collective action clauses; immunizing payments systems from third-party interference; establishing a Sovereign Debt Adjustment Facility in the International Monetary Fund; and building a European Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism. The proposals, as well as the underlying assessments they are based on, are the subject of serious debate and discussion among scholars, policy makers, civil society organizations and private market actors. In other words, this paper frames the broad parameters of the current debate over how best to govern sovereign debt restructuring. Understanding, engaging with and advancing this debate are the necessary first steps."},

{"title": "Capital Flows and Spillovers", "authors": ["Şebnem Kalemli-Özcan"], "publishing_date": "2015-03-30T10:00:00Z", "abstract": "This paper shows that debt flows have contractionary effects on emerging markets’ output, while equity flows have expansionary effects. Such correlations can be driven by counter-cyclical debt flows and pro-cyclical equity flows, or by debt flows that lead to an appreciation and hurt exports, and by equity flows that improve the productivity of the real economy, broadly defined. It focuses on business cycle frequencies and the effect of global risk appetite in driving capital flows into emerging markets. A positive initial impact of debt flows on output is followed by a negative impact. Equity flows have a positive impact on output initially, and thereafter. Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows have a positive effect on output only after a two-year lag, and if this period coincides with increased global uncertainty, the effect on output reverses, but the total effect stays positive. This result also holds for equity flows, suggesting that during increased periods of uncertainty, private investors leave emerging markets. Quantitative impacts are not large except in the case of FDI flows."},
{"title": "The Shadow Banking System of China and International Regulatory Cooperation", "authors": ["Zheng Liansheng"], "publishing_date": "2015-03-24T15:48:00Z", "abstract": "The “shadow banking” system, as a credit intermediary outside of regulation and the regular banking system, has been regarded as one of the critical sources of the global financial crisis. International coordination of regulation on shadow banking has substantially improved since 2009, but bilateral and multilateral cooperation among advanced economies and emerging markets has made little progress. This is due to a combination of factors: the changing interests and attitudes of the developed economies; the passive approach of the developing world; great differences in financial market structures; the lack of enforcement of international standards; overreliance on political pressure through the Group of Twenty; and the professional, technical and linguistic weaknesses of emerging countries. China has witnessed a rapid growth of shadow banking in recent years and its attitude to international coordination in regulation of the shadow banking system has changed from a following strategy to a constructive, inclusive and pragmatic approach. However, its main goal is to develop a comprehensive domestic regulatory framework for shadow banking. Enhancing international collaboration presents a number of challenges. To overcome these challenges, necessary institutional reforms include a system of information sharing, the establishment of a third-party consultancy mechanism, further improvements to the regulatory framework and investments in building the regulatory capacity of emerging countries."},

While account penetration is nearly universal in high-income nations, it is only 41 percent in developing countries.  This paper contributes to the discussion about the enablers and barriers to responsible financial inclusion by assessing to what extent differences in the adoption of post-crisis global regulatory standards can explain cross-country variation in financial inclusion. Some of the questions this paper sets out to answer include if implementation of global regulatory standards hampered financial inclusion or helped it and if national regulators in developing countries have been able to apply international regulatory recommendations in a proportionate manner. Using the 2011 Global Findex database, two original indices of financial inclusion for 90 developing and emerging economies were constructed in order to benchmark countries’ performance in this dimension. These indices were then used as the dependent variables in cross-country regression analyses, evaluating the impact of various aspects of global regulatory standards. "},

The authors seek to empirically determine whether there were spillover effects over and above the domestic impact from the imposition of such bans. There is some evidence that the bans were unsuccessful, at least insofar as they did not take into account the global component a short-selling ban might have. In the individual countries they examine, the bans had relatively little impact. Nevertheless, the paper’s finding that equity returns do not appear to show a decline may be evidence that the bans stemmed further deterioration in stock prices that policy makers sought to avoid."},

Using an analytical model that includes monetary supply and demand, the authors examine the influences of RMB cross-border settlement on China's domestic interest rate, asset price and foreign exchange reserves. They examine the differing ways that RMB settlement behaves with the various items in China's balance of payments, such as imports, exports, foreign direct investment, overseas direct investment, RMB Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor, RMB Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor and cross-border loans. RMB settlement in different items was found to lead to differing effects on China's economy. The authors address various aspects of China's macroeconomic policy, identifying opportunities and risks, and making recommendations for stable growth without negative by-products."},
{"title": "The Risk of OTC Derivatives: Canadian Lessons for Europe and the G20", "authors": ["Chiara Oldani"], "publishing_date": "2015-02-20T10:22:00Z", "abstract": "Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives played an important role in the buildup of systemic risk in financial markets before 2007 and in spreading volatility throughout global financial markets during the crisis. In recognition of the financial and economic benefits of derivatives products, the Group of Twenty (G20) moved to regulate the use of OTC derivatives. Attention has been drawn to the detrimental effects of the United States and the European Union to coordinate OTC reform, but this overlooks an important aspect of the post-crisis process: the exemption of non-financial operators from OTC derivative regulatory requirements. Critically, they remain exempt under existing legislation regardless of the risks they continue to pose through unreported trades and counterparty risks to financial firms. There is still uncertainty around the pricing of derivatives for non-financial operators that could pose a risk to the financial system. This paper concludes that the G20 should seek to promote transparency in the trading of OTC derivatives of sovereigns, local governments and other non-financial operators by adopting accounting criteria able to provide information on off-balance sheet assets and liabilities, and eventually adhering to the centralized counterparty system and the collateralized system of trading."},

There are two disparate perspectives in the literature on the impact of this change on international financial regulation: the weakening cooperation view, which sees an attenuation of international cooperation due to this change, and the enduring status quo view, which sees the domination of global financial governance by advanced economies persisting even despite it. This paper provides an alternative — and more positive — view of the increased representation of emerging economies in global financial governance related to international financial regulation, by offering a direct and systematic analysis of its effects on the role of emerging economies in the international standard-setting process and on their compliance with these standards, arguing that emerging economies are now meaningful, but still constrained, rule makers."},

The SPFTZ’s initial impressions are assessed, especially its impact on the opening of China’s capital account and financial liberalization. The hope is that the success of the SPFTZ, and more pilot policies replicated in China, will give rise to a more balanced Chinese economy in the following decade."},

In spite of this, important challenges remain in terms of legitimacy, transparency and accountability for principal international standard setters as well as concerning the effective contribution of emerging economies. Recent Brazilian experience with RCAP points to some of the gaps that must be filled in order to serve the interests of a broader range of actors in the international regulatory landscape."},

This paper examines China’s minilateral diplomacy in the financial area. Although China has been involved in regional financial cooperation for the last 15 years, its recent minilateral initiatives, such as the New Development Bank, the Contingent Reserve Arrangement and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, are far more China-centred. What are China’s motivations? Will these minilateral schemes undermine the traditional multilateral institutions? This paper argues that the Chinese government seeks to use financial minilateralism to stimulate reform of global financial institutions, provide financial public goods for its regional neighbours and fellow developing countries, as well as directly promote China’s economic and political interests. China’s financial minilateralism is not meant to overthrow the existing multilateral institutions, but this could change depending on the interaction between how the world responds to China’s new activism and the domestic political dynamics in China. Western countries should understand and accommodate China’s aspirations and encourage China to keep its minilateralism open."},
{"title": "Legal Interoperability as a Tool for Combatting Fragmentation", "authors": ["Rolf H. Weber"], "publishing_date": "2014-12-18T09:59:00Z", "abstract": "The recently developed term “legal interoperability” addresses the process of making legal rules cooperate across jurisdictions. It can facilitate global communication, reduce costs in cross-border business and drive innovation, thereby creating a level playing field for the next generation of technologies and cultural exchange. This paper portrays legal interoperability as a spectrum with full harmonization of normative rules between jurisdictions on one end and a complete fragmentation of legal systems on the other, the ideal existing between the two poles. In cyberspace, legal interoperability should be designed to function on four broad layers of complex systems: technology, data, human elements and institutional aspects. The regulatory models of harmonization, standardization, mutual recognition and other approaches (such as reciprocity or cooperation) should be mapped with the existing sources of law, identifying the most appropriate instrument for a given substantive topic. Legal interoperability is a complex issue and the monetary costs of non-interoperable laws in a highly networked world will increase. If an adequate level of legal interoperability is not achieved and a far-reaching fragmentation of legal jurisdictions prevails, the likelihood of dominant states enlarging the geographical scope of their laws through extraterritorial application increases. Due to this complexity, nuances in the design of rule-making processes must gain importance so that unintended consequences of regimes that are not legally interoperable can be avoided."},

{"title": "Sovereign Debt Crisis Management: Lessons from the 2012 Greek Debt Restructuring", "authors": ["Miranda Xafa"], "publishing_date": "2014-06-12T09:21:00Z", "abstract": "The 2012 Greek debt exchange was a watershed event in the euro area debt crisis. It generated fears of contagion and was viewed as a threat to the euro itself. There is a heated debate as to whether the debt restructuring should have taken place sooner. This paper argues that a deep haircut up front, under threat of legislative action, would have been seen as unnecessary and deeply coercive. But delaying the restructuring beyond mid-2011, when it became clear that Greece’s debt was unsustainable, was unjustified. The delay reduced the stock of privately held debt subject to a haircut, possibly making an official debt restructuring inevitable down the road. Initial fears that the Greek debt restructuring would pose a serious threat to the euro area’s financial stability proved to be exaggerated. On the contrary, it demonstrated that an orderly default involving a pre-emptive debt restructuring is possible in a monetary union, provided appropriate firewalls are in place to limit contagion risks. With crisis management institutions and procedures now in place in the euro area, and with much stricter fiscal surveillance, the Greek experience is likely to remain unique in the history of debt restructurings; however, some lessons can be learned from its specific features."},
{"title": "Global Cybercrime: The Interplay of Politics and Law", "authors": ["Aaron Shull"], "publishing_date": "2014-06-20T15:11:00Z", "abstract": "Examining global cybercrime as solely a legal issue misses an important facet of the problem. Understanding the applicable legal rules, both domestically and internationally, is important. However, major state actors are using concerted efforts to engage in nefarious cyber activities with the intention of advancing their economic and geostrategic interests. This paper explores the recent unsealing of a 31-count indictment against five Chinese government officials and a significant cyber breach, perpetrated by Chinese actors against Western oil, energy and petrochemical companies. The paper concludes by noting that increased cooperation among governments is necessary, but unlikely to occur as long as the discourse surrounding cybercrime remains so heavily politicized and securitized. If governments coalesced around the notion of trying to prevent the long-term degradation of trust in the online economy, they may profitably advance the dialogue away from mutual suspicion and toward mutual cooperation."},

It was the first time in nearly a decade that the topic attracted major international media attention. A key aspect of the post-WCIT discussion has centred on the role of “swing states” in this global debate. So far, most of this work has been based on predefined groups of countries or focused on countries based on anecdotal evidence of a vibrant tech community or existing relationships. The study discussed in this paper applied a more systematic approach. The research revealed some interesting patterns among certain groups of states. A core group of potential swing states — a total of 30 countries — are identified based on their voting behaviour at the WCIT, their various memberships and a range of relevant indicators. This list offers a road map for future in-depth studies. Ideally, it will also serve as a resource for practitioners and academics alike for comparison with current efforts and for future strategic planning that focuses on engaging other actors internationally."},

There is evidence that the CETA talks are not conclusively finalized, but that the Government of Canada wanted to expedite resolution of the agreement talks to avoid losing the European’s focus to the TTIP, and to prevent delay due to increasing debate surrounding contentious elements. Once finalized, the TTIP will be among the world’s largest trade agreements. This paper compares how CETA and the TTIP are similar and in what ways they are different. Given that the CETA talks are closer to finalization than the TTIP, this experience may be useful to determine how the TTIP negotiations might unfold, especially considering there have been suggestions that CETA is a “template” for the TTIP. These ideas are explored throughout this paper through the lens of five lessons learned so far in these negotiations: the agreements will take longer than expected; the agreements contain both “traditional” and “twenty-first century” components; the public is concerned about the agreements; regulatory convergence is difficult; and multilateralism still matters."},

This paper, authored by Chungding Li, Jing Wang and John Whalley, explores a possible description of mega deals by making an inventory of current deals in place, under discussion or negotiation, and deals yet to be considered. The paper also examines China’s situation regarding deals that may include or exclude the country by looking at descriptive analysis and summarized general equilibrium modelling calculations on the potential impact of these deals — these consistently show that the access benefits from mega deal negotiations may be essential for China’s security in market access. The authors conclude that China will be driven to engage in its own mega trade deals by the need to compete in the global trade system. China can influence the future development of the trading system by its stance toward mega deals, and mega deals would most likely shape the future of China’s economy."},

Bohl", "Philipp Kaufmann"], "publishing_date": "2014-07-29T10:47:00Z", "abstract": "Soaring prices in European alternative energy stocks and their subsequent tumble have attracted attention from both investors and academics. This paper by Martin T. Bohl, Philipp Kaufmann and Pierre L. Siklos extends recent research to an international setting and analyzes whether the explosive price behaviour of the mid-2000s was driven by rising crude oil prices and an overall bullish market sentiment. Inflation-adjusted US alternative energy stock prices do not exhibit signs of explosiveness. The authors find strong evidence of explosive price behaviour for European and global sector indices, even after controlling for a set of explanatory variables, while the sector indices plunged with the outbreak of the global financial crisis, idiosyncratic components continued to rise and did not start to decline until after world equity markets had already begun to recover in 2009. This finding suggests a substantial revaluation of alternative energy stock prices in light of intensifying sector competition and shrinking sales margins, and casts some doubts on the existence of a speculative bubble. The authors observe temporary episodes of explosiveness between 2005 and 2007 followed by rapid collapses, indicating the presence of some irrational exuberance among investors."},

However, the neocooperative and free market management system has attracted the ire of larger competitors such as the United States and the European Union. This paper examines the history of the New Zealand dairy industry from the 1840s, through the precarious days of the First and Second World Wars, to the recent discussions of trade liberalization through multilateral mega deals. Aware of its geographic and size limitations, New Zealand has remained agile and receptive to change. Throughout most of the twentieth century, the United Kingdom was New Zealand’s most important customer, but cognisant of the need to diversify, New Zealand expanded its dairy trade into the Asia-Pacific, the Americas and the Middle East. In addition, after the failure of GATT and since the 1980s, New Zealand restructured its dairy industry with the New Zealand Dairy Board and later Fonterra as the sole exporter."},

International negotiations through the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have made little progress since the 2009 Copenhagen Conference of the Parties. Hopes have been raised for the 2015 meeting planned for Paris, which is supposed to plan for the period after 2020. While a plethora of institutions have emerged to complement (or compete with) the UNFCC and the idea of a “bottom-up” approach is all the rage, this paper argues that heads of state and government have to become seriously engaged before Paris. The UN Secretary-General has called a summit for later this year. The Group of Twenty has a role in mobilizing the necessary finance. The paper calls for a summit of private sector leaders, as well as governments, to identify the principal roadblocks that stand in the way of what must be the greatest investment opportunity of the twenty-first century."},

The proposed SDF would not require complex treaty negotiations to be enacted and it would complement existing institutions and processes to produce more efficient and effective resolution of sovereign financial distress when it arises by engaging both troubled and stable sovereigns in continuous dialogue with creditors and official institutions. By fomenting early action, the SDF would aim to prevent scenarios where deep debt restructuring becomes the inevitable resolution of severe sovereign crises."},

Boughton"], "publishing_date": "2014-03-20T13:38:00Z", "abstract": "Canadians have long harboured a desire to “punch above their weight” in international diplomacy, an aspiration justified by Canada’s position in the world both geographically and culturally. This paper examines one aspect of that effort: Canada’s role in international financial governance, particularly within the International Monetary Fund. The key issue for the future is whether Canada will continue to have the capacity and the will to take leading positions and actions in the face of increasing competition from the rapidly growing emerging market countries."},

With a dominant focus in the discourse on these purported benefits, little attention has been given to the impacts of land acquisition on the local people whose livelihoods depend on land-based activities. Using a case study of bio-ethanol development in the Chisumbanje communal lands of Zimbabwe, this project assesses the processes and local livelihood implications of biofuel development and considers who is likely to bear the costs."},

It is somewhat more interesting geopolitically from various non-traditional security perspectives (for example, human security, cultural security, energy security, economic security and environmental security); but it is truly important only in the one respect that attracts the least attention and action from policy makers: namely, ecospheric security."},
{"title": "A Markov Switching Approach to Herding", "authors": ["Martin T. Bohl", "Pierre L. Siklos", "Arne C. Klein"], "publishing_date": "2013-12-04T09:50:00Z", "abstract": "Existing models of market herding suffer from several drawbacks. Measures that assume herd behaviour is constant over time or independent of the economy are not only economically unreasonable, but describe the data poorly. First, if returns are stationary, then a two-regime model is required to describe the data. Second, existing models of time-varying herding cannot be estimated from daily or weekly data, and are unable to accommodate factors that explain changes in this behaviour. To overcome these deficiencies, this paper proposes a Markov switching herding model. By means of time-varying transition probabilities, the model is able to link variations in herding behaviour to proxies for sentiment or the macroeconomic environment. The evidence for the US stock market reveals that during periods of high volatility, investors disproportionately rely on fundamentals rather than on market consensus."},

Focussing on the case of Greece, this paper examines how the euro crisis precipitated large International Monetary Fund (IMF) loans that violated the framework developed on the basis of the preceding decade to prevent a costly delay in restructuring. The paper reveals that safeguards meant to prevent the IMF from providing support for crisis countries without a reasonably clear path to debt sustainability failed. In fact, changes made in the context of the euro crisis to the IMF’s framework for lending in severe sovereign debt crises will weaken the IMF’s effectiveness in future crises. The paper concludes with four suggestions for how to re-establish an adequate framework for IMF intervention in severe debt crises in the future."},

The security of this growing domain has become highly contested among states, the private sector and civil society. In this paper, the sixth in the Internet Governance Papers, Ronald J.

He argues that these processes may end up subverting the domain entirely, possibly leading to a system wide instability and perhaps international violence. We must have a clear vision and strategy to implement a security framework, and this requires coordinated work at multiple levels and a wide variety of stakeholders."},

Kennedy (JFK), an event that continues to spark interest to this day. In this paper, James G. Blight and janet M. Lang examine JFK’s cautious skepticism — his “Black Swan logic”— which he used to scrutinize the potentially disastrous consequences of US military intervention. In doing so, JFK met with tremendous protest from his hawkish advisers — but a life of debilitating back pain, near-death experiences and barely controlled Addison’s disease gave him the steely resolved to trust his instincts, against the better judgment of doctors, generals and political advisers. JFK’s black swan logic helped him to avoid his hawkish advisers’ forceful attempts to bring the United States into conflicts that would have quickly escalated into nuclear war. Shedding new light on his misunderstood behaviour during an era of nuclear uncertainty, Blight and Lang conclude that JFK’s skeptical, cautious approach is as indispensable now as it was during his presidency. "},

This paper clarifies China’s interests in the Arctic and touches on future trends in this regard. Beginning with a discussion of China’s recent Arctic capacity building and diplomacy, this paper suggests that China looks north for basically four reasons: it is influenced by environmental changes in the Arctic; it is drawn by the business opportunities arising from the opening of the Arctic passages and better access to Arctic resources; and it is also committed to maintaining good governance in the Arctic — which is also in its best interests. At present, China’s participation in Arctic affairs is limited, but it is preparing to make greater contributions to good governance in the Arctic."},

The 2008 global financial crisis encouraged the BRIC states (Brazil, the Russian Federation, India and the People’s Republic of China [PRC]) to work together to demand fundamental reforms to the international financial architecture and to move towards a multicurrency-based IMS. Promoting ruble internationalization has been central to Russian efforts in this regard, and has served important domestic political, economic and symbolic purposes as well, yet Russian concerns about the US dollar-based IMS and its simultaneous ambitions for ruble internationalization have incompatible implications for Russian attitudes towards the PRC and the RMB."},

At the same time, the crisis and its extraordinary policy responses have left a number of legacies that pose significant adjustment challenges to the international community. In this paper, written for CIGI’s conference, Five Years After the Fall: The Governance Legacies of the Global Financial Crisis, James A.

Successfully addressing both short- and medium-term policy challenges requires policy horizons much longer than the myopic orientation adopted by too many, Haley argues, and it will take global economic leadership to secure the cooperation that is needed to strike a judicious balancing of adjustment burdens."},

Klein"], "publishing_date": "2013-05-09T10:10:00Z", "abstract": "Surprisingly, little is known about the effects of short-sale constraints on herd behaviour. Since institutional investors have come to dominate mature stock markets and rely extensively on short sales, constraining these traders may influence the asset pricing process. The literature on short-selling restrictions focusses mainly on a ban's impact on market efficiency, liquidity and overpricing. The authors examine bans on selected financial stocks in six countries during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, which provided a setting to analyze the impact of short-sale restrictions. In particular, the authors focussed on short-sale constraints’ effect on institutional investors’ trading behaviour and the possibility of generating herding behaviour. They conclude that the empirical evidence shows that short-selling restrictions exhibit either no influence on herding formation or induce adverse herding."},

Regulatory authorities in a number of countries imposed short-sale constraints aimed at preventing excessive stock market declines. This paper examines bans on selected financial stocks in six countries during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. These provided a setting to analyze the impact of short-sale restrictions on feedback trading. The findings suggest that, in the majority of markets examined, restrictions of this kind amplify positive feedback trading during periods of high volatility and, hence, contribute to stock market downturns. On balance, therefore, short-selling bans do not contribute to enhancing financial stability."},

Since 2000, however, international migration has moved to the top of the global governance agenda and a whole range of partnerships have taken shape. In the space of a decade, how and why has migration shifted from being an issue that was of marginal interest on the international development agenda to one that is increasingly at its centre? How has one of the most contentious North-South issues of the 1990s become the focus of so much dialogue and cooperation between them? This paper provides a possible answer to these questions, which provides a context for understanding the nature of cooperation between the EU and ACP Group of States on international migration governance."},

Canada has considerable assets that could support US diplomacy in the region, including the legacy of its good offices and its close ties with the US military; however, these assets are outweighed by several liabilities.

Even if the United States — still the dominant world power — is able to fix its myriad economic problems, it will no longer be able to exert the influence it once could. The United States must work alongside others — and accept that others will sometimes work together without it — to deal with a wide range of persistent and emerging global problems and issues. A new kind of voluntary and targeted multilateral problem solving is taking shape, building on the traditions of collective defence and collective security. This new approach is based not on formal consensus, but rather on cooperation emerging out of an informal process of consultation, with final, decision-making authority continuing to reside with national authorities. New, informal partnerships in the realms of security, economics and global governance seem likely to emerge among countries that are not themselves “great powers” by the traditional definition, but that nonetheless have both compelling strategic interests in a peaceful, prosperous world and the diplomatic and, sometimes, military capacity and political disposition to make a significant difference."},

There is too little appreciation that earlier international monetary systems required cooperation precisely because exchange rate systems rendered economies dependent on collaboration between the participants. This paper argues that credibility and trust in any new international regulatory framework must first begin at home with a determination for fiscal and monetary policies to work in harmony. This includes cooperation, if not coordination, of regulatory and supervisory functions to ensure that macroprudential policies effectively complement domestic monetary policy and provide an additional tool to implement a sound macroeconomic framework that will soften the blow from the next financial crisis."},

For some of the delegates, staying free of charge in five-star hotels and receiving the equivalent of five months’ pay in one week of per diems made continued talks more attractive than achieving peace. The generous incentives seduced the conflicting parties away from whatever interest they might have had in actually reaching an agreement, encouraged delegates to create procedural barriers where none had previously existed, and promoted fragmentation among the rebel groups at the negotiating table. Though the paper uses contemporary African case studies to illustrate the argument, this issue transcends the African continent, as perks are a long-established diplomatic practice. To deal effectively with the unintended problems they create requires fundamental cultural and attitudinal changes in most international organizations."},

{"title": "Fiscal Asymmetries and the Survival of the Euro Zone", "authors": ["Paul R. Masson"], "publishing_date": "2011-12-09T14:54:00Z", "abstract": "The independence of the European Central Bank (ECB), seemingly guaranteed by its statutes, is presently under attack. The ECB has been led to acquire large amounts of government debt of the weaker euro zone members, both to help contain their interest costs and to help protect the solvency of banks throughout the zone that hold their debt. This paper presents a model of a dependent central bank that internalizes the government’s budget constraint. Using a Barro-Gordon framework, the model embodies both the desire to stimulate output and to provide monetary financing to governments. As a result of the inability to pre-commit to first-best policies, the central bank produces excess inflation — a tendency partially reduced in a monetary union. The model implies that not only shock asymmetries, but also fiscal asymmetries, are important in the membership calculus of desirable monetary unions. On the basis of this framework, calibrated to euro zone data, the current membership is shown not to be optimal: other members would benefit from the expulsion of several countries, notably Greece, Italy and France. A narrow monetary union centred around Germany is sometimes mooted as a preferable alternative, especially if it could guarantee central bank independence. However, simulation results suggest that such a narrow monetary union would not be in Germany’s interest: though better than the euro zone with a dependent central bank, it would not internalize enough trade to make it more attractive than the resumption of monetary autonomy by Germany."},

The cost of living is high, ratcheted up by inefficient ports, monopolistic transport markets, high fees and taxes. The appearance of “openness” in trade and finance hides protectionism. The economic framework in the Caribbean is shaped by the political structure, making it difficult for governments to alter the economic structure — where state employment tends to be high, few political parties will risk the wrath of public sector workers. Real change has not been undertaken because the current situation in the Caribbean suits the people with influence."},

This paper demonstrates that environmental factors are often the hidden cause of the migration of Egyptians from one region to another. The analysis is situated in the broader studies on migration, and also shows why the findings of this study are significant. The paper makes recommendations that will hopefully help policy makers in understanding the causes of environmental migration and assist them in developing policies to address the problem of environmentally induced migration in a sustainable way."},
{"title": "Security Sector Reform in Haiti One Year After the Earthquake", "authors": ["Isabelle Fortin"], "publishing_date": "2011-03-24T09:33:00Z", "abstract": "When the January 12, 2010 earthquake hit Haiti, the country was in the midst of a second round of security and justice system reforms supported by the international community. The quake killed hundreds of thousands of people, including some who played a critical role in implementing these reforms. Damaged infrastructure and casualties in key justice and security positions hindered the existing security institutions’ ability to respond to the problems caused by the destruction. This paper examines how the security and justice reforms were affected by the earthquake, and the new security challenges faced by the population in the post-earthquake period. The disaster provides an opportunity to consider security justice matters through a new lens. Security and justice reform is the responsibility of everyone — the public, businesses, the police, judges and civil society organizations. Cooperation between all of these groups is needed to establish the accountability mechanisms required to effectively steer Haiti’s transformation process."},

The G20 could play a major role in determining whether we are to live in a time of enhanced cooperative governance or in a zero-sum international competition. To achieve its potential, Heinbecker calls for a “reciprocal, strong relationship” between the G20 and the UN, and stresses the importance of the G20’s relationship to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Based on the evolution of the G8, he suggests that the G20 will begin to consider adding political and security issues to its agenda. The author highlights the world’s most pressing hybrid issues, which a broader G20 agenda could help to tackle, such as “the economic and financial dimensions of climate change, food and energy security, and support for the political transformation of the Middle East and North Africa, which will have major economic dimensions and impact.” A former ambassador and permanent representative of Canada to the UN, Paul Heinbecker is one of Canada’s most experienced commentators on foreign policy and international governance."},

The paper gives a concise account of the formation of the Group of Twenty (G20) finance ministers and central bank governors in the late 1990s, in the wake of financial crises in Asia and Latin America, which was elevated to a leaders’ summit forum at the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008. Smith wraps up the paper with a discussion of the differences in the G8 and G20 models, concluding that the G20 process is still the best option for meeting the challenges of complex global governance issues."},

Heading up this team was Bruce Riedel, a former adviser to Presidents Clinton and Bush and a former CIA officer. This paper, based on a CIGI Signature Lecture given by Mr. Riedel in April 2010, discusses the history of the US war on terror since 9/11, specifically the actors involved in initiating the al-Qaeda declaration of war on the US and its allies, and the recent terrorist plots and attacks linked to al-Qaeda, which demonstrate that al-Qaeda and its allies continue to mount terrorist attacks despite the efforts of the US to thwart terrorism. President Obama inherited a war in Afghanistan that was unsuccessful, under-funded and lacked a clearly defined strategy. The response he developed for Afghanistan is a complex one involving regional and international policies — particularly in Pakistan, where al-Qaeda has a network of insurgent groups — but it also involves military force, diplomacy and changing public opinion concerning the US. This paper assesses the progress that Obama has made in Afghanistan and Pakistan 15 months after taking office, and considers whether the US will actually be able win the war on terror."},

This paper finds the economic effects on the countries studied – Jamaica, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, and St. Lucia – will likely be minimal, despite the fierce opposition to and criticism of the EPA when it was adopted in October 2008, predicting that it will be disastrous for Caribbean economies,. This paper emphasizes that to benefit fully from the EPA, Caribbean countries will need to proceed with plans for the Caribbean Single Market Economy (CSME). The EPA can, therefore, provide the framework that will allow the Caribbean to compete in a liberalized global economy."},
{"title": "A Plan to Stabilize Afghanistan", "authors": ["Shahmahmood Miakhel "], "publishing_date": "2010-04-28T14:01:00Z", "abstract": "Afghanistan’s problems are well known: rampant insecurity, endemic corruption, deep-seated poverty and weak governance. Unfortunately most of the strategies advanced to address these issues have lacked clear, effective and culturally-adapted implementation frameworks, making them more like wish lists than concrete roadmaps. Based on wide experience and engagement in Afghanistan’s state-building project since 2001 – in the United Nations, Afghan government, and civil society – the author provides a broad outline for a new strategy to stabilize Afghanistan. At the core of this new strategy is a focus on priority areas, or centres of gravity, and an emphasis on local-level participation in program design and implementation. While the window of opportunity to stabilize and rebuild Afghanistan is closing, there are straight forward steps that can be taken to turn the tide of Afghanistan’s current crisis. This new approach will not require massive new infusions of resources, but rather robust political will and resolve among both Afghans and international actors, something that is increasingly in short supply."},

For the countries of CARIFORUM, beset by small internal markets, loss of preferential trade advantages, a downturn in demand for their traditional products and vulnerability to global economic pressures, the transformation to a knowledge-based, ICT-intensive society could assist in propelling the region toward desired levels of growth and development. However, access and affordability, lack of infrastructure, fragmented policy and regulatory frameworks and differential levels of educational attainment, among other issues, are hindering progress toward that goal. In examining instances of effective and exemplary ICT policy applications in selected countries, this paper distills the critical qualities and interventions required for the Caribbean to benefit from global innovations in ICTs. The following developments are needed: • The political will among regional governments to lead by example in providing the policy, legal and regulatory environments suitable for the ICT industry’s growth. • The creation of an investment-friendly environment that would attract foreign direct investment in ICT-intensive industries, while also encouraging local ICT-related entrepreneurship. • Public and private sector investment in communications and general infrastructure to enable all social groups to have effective access to ICTs. • Investment in ICT education and information literacy at all levels of the education system. • The financing and promotion of research and development (R&D) at the tertiary level of the education system and among innovators in the private sector. This includes creating and managing the knowledge required for economic transformation. • A proactive and innovative private sector willing to lead in the use and exploration of ICT and to take advantage of favourable policy and investment opportunities, where these exist. • More integrated efforts among government departments and agencies in planning and implementing ICT strategies."},

The Obama administration is constructing policies that are at the same time consistent with and different from those of the Bush administration. For example, the administration is proceeding with efforts to win support for tighter rules on sensitive nuclear technologies in the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and to establish international nuclear fuel banks and other supply assurances. By contrast, the fate of the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP), a centrepiece of the Bush administration’s nuclear approach, is still to be determined. However, concerns such as enhancing safeguards and security and efforts against nuclear terrorism will be integral to President Obama’s international nuclear energy policies."},
{"title": "Caribbean Regional Governance and the Sovereignty/Statehood Problem", "authors": ["Matthew Louis Bishop "], "publishing_date": "2010-01-29T16:03:00Z", "abstract": "It has long been argued that the English-speaking Caribbean states require the establishment of some kind of effective and binding regional system of governance. What is more, the many deficiencies of the current system are widely known and acknowledged. Why, then, have they not been seriously addressed over a period of more than 40 years? This paper argues that the key blockage is the continued adherence of Caribbean political leaders to a conception of sovereignty and statehood that is inappropriate and outdated. These are no more than constructed concepts that have been framed and deployed differently in other parts of the world, notably in Europe. The conventional Caribbean understanding of sovereignty and statehood needs urgently to be opened up, unpacked and discussed in a frank and open debate with the people of the region. The paper sets out a series of steps by which the region’s leaders can initiate and lead such a debate prior to designing a new set of governance arrangements for CARICOM that would permit the substantive strengthening of sovereignty via its creative pooling. Only when a more nuanced and sophisticated understanding of what sovereignty means in the contemporary world order is embedded into the Caribbean political culture will the leadership be able to build the effective institutions of regional governance that remain so badly needed."},

It is the world’s largest supplier of natural uranium and a supplier of nuclear technology and expertise. However, recent announcements such as the Ontario government’s plans to postpone indefinitely the construction of two nuclear reactors at its Darlington facility, and the federal government’s intention to privatize Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL), the nuclear science and engineering company, raise questions about nuclear energy in Canada. This paper provides an analysis of the future of nuclear energy in Canada and the likely parameters of any revival. Findings include: • Canada has lost the domestic political consensus that made possible the original development of the CANDU reactor technology; • The Ontario decision to delay indefinitely its plans for the construction of new nuclear reactors is emblematic of this loss and indicative of the obstacles confronting the Canadian nuclear industry; • Fragmented federal-provincial energy policy jurisdictions and political gamesmanship result in domestic market inertia effectively thwarting any prospects for a Canadian nuclear revival; • Without a revival in the domestic market for nuclear energy, AECL is unlikely to be successful marketing and selling reactors internationally; • Privatization of AECL will do little to improve the company’s prospects and will mean the end of the CANDU reactor technology."},

It undertook structural reforms, including consolidating organizational structures, introducing “clusters” to address cross-cutting issues, and reviewing its committees. It introduced management system reforms, including a results-based budgeting process. It pursued governance reforms to improve decision making and deal with the issue of enlarging its membership. It undertook reforms for enhancing relations with non-members. It also introduced financial reforms to redistribute the burden among members and place the organization on a sound footing. Some of these reforms were more successful than others, but the experience offers several insights for those leading reforms in other multilateral organizations. The reforms have given the organization greater value to its stakeholders and greater relevance to the world. While its journey towards being a more global player is not yet complete, the organization’s record of implementing a series of successful reforms suggests it can continue to reform in the years ahead."},

There is growing recognition that the traditional state-centric intergovernmental model of addressing global environmental problems is insufficient in the face of increasingly complex and overlapping environmental issues. There are serious questions about the ability or willingness of states, individually and collectively, to respond to the most pressing environmental challenges. The erosion of confidence in and the dominance of a state-centric governance model has simultaneously resulted from and provoked significant innovation. While there is growing discussion of institutional reform at the international level, including reform to the United Nations Environment Programme and the creation of a new global organization to address these problems, there is also a fragmentation of governance processes to other jurisdictional levels and actors. Corporations, social and environmental organizations, public-private partnerships, substate governments, and even local communities have already begun to conceive and implement governance initiatives to address global environmental problems. This paper reflects upon these innovative institutional dynamics and assesses their prospects to produce effective, legitimate and equitable outcomes. It concludes with a series of questions to guide future analysis and to better understand the prospects for improving the practice of global environmental governance."},

The most visible indication of this was US President George W. Bush’s labeling of Iran as a member of the “axis of evil” in 2002.

This paper seeks to locate the Obama administration’s efforts within the history of US-Iranian relations while also highlighting the contemporary issues that would inform a constructive dialogue, such as the upcoming Iranian presidential elections. Improved dialogue between the two countries could help to improve the situations in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, demonstrating how overlapping areas of interest may provide a new path for US-Iran relations."},
{"title": "The BRICSAM Countries and Changing World Economic Power:Scenarios to 2050", "authors": ["Manmohan Agarwal"], "publishing_date": "2008-10-12T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "Rapid economic growth in the large developing countries collectively known as BRICSAM (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and Mexico) has the potential to change the balance of economic power in the world. This paper analyzes this potential building on developments in these economies over the past four decades in the context of the evolution of the world economy. This evolution has two significant features: increasing economic integration and a hiatus in growth. Increasing integration can be observed in the almost universal rise in the share of the exports of goods and services in GDP, and the increase in private capital flows. There has been a hiatus in growth since the 1973-1974 increase in the price of oil. This paper's analysis of various scenarios concerning the relative size of major economies until 2050 based on incomes measured at official exchange rates, a preference explained in the paper, suggests a sharp increase in the share of world income of China and partly India over the next four decades. Coupled with the expected increase in the share of China in world exports during this period, the prospect is of a substantial increase in China's influence over world economic management. This influence will be even more substantial if China is able to build alliances with the other BRICSAM countries. It is in the common interest of the BRICSAM countries to ensure that the workings of the major international economic institutions contribute to maintaining the free flow of goods, services and capital necessary for these economies to achieve their potential."},

This paper examines the extent to which China's engagement with Africa has produced mutual benefits for both and whether Africa is reaping the necessary benefits required for poverty alleviation and economic development. Chinese state-owned enterprises have invested billions of dollars in foreign reserves, construction and engineering resources assisting African oil-producing exporters. While many in the West have started to question China's extraordinary level of interest in Africa - in particular, its economic engagement with perceived repressive regimes - African leaders view China's entry as a means of pulling Africa onto the path of globalization. It is thus important that African leaders and policy makers ensure that Chinese trade and investment bring reciprocal and tangible benefits for Africans, and contribute to economic stability and good governance."},
{"title": "The Economics of Nuclear Power: Current Debates and Issues for Future Consideration", "authors": [], "publishing_date": "2008-02-24T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "Existing nuclear power plants in the United States and Canada have been recovering from the pre-1998 cost overruns, unreliability and safety concerns. The favourable economics of existing plants (after debt has been written down or otherwise managed) have attracted private sector investment in capacity uprates and life extensions. This improved performance, coupled with claimed construction cost reductions for new nuclear power plant designs, has been heralded as evidence of a \"Nuclear Renaissance.\" Estimates comparing the economics of new nuclear plants with alternatives such as natural gas-fired generation spur debate over the accuracy of the data used. It is clear that the economics of nuclear power vary inversely with interest rates and improve as natural gas prices rise and become more volatile. In competitive electricity markets, new nuclear plants may not be financially attractive to private sector investors without government action to tilt the economics in nuclear's favour, at least for FOAK (first-of-a-kind) plants. Some governments are exploring incentives for the construction and operation of new nuclear designs in order to avoid greenhouse gas emissions and enhance energy security. The industry's response to the incentives enacted in the United States will provide fresh evidence about the economics of nuclear power."},
{"title": "First, Do No Harm: The Role and Responsibility of Canada as a Destination Country in South-North Migration", "authors": ["Laura Dawson"], "publishing_date": "2008-04-26T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "Analyses of South-North migration usually focus on the consequences of migration for the sending countries and recommend measures to improve development outcomes.This paper instead examines the role and responsibility of migrant-receiving states, and constructs a framework of intervention areas for Canada from work conducted in other developed countries. One major concern is that wealthy, migrant-receiving countries are impeding their own overseas development assistance efforts through migration related policies that are contradictory or incoherent across such policy areas as migration, labour, trade, development aid and international affairs. The paper concludes with a discussion of the reasons Canada should reverse this trend and embark on a new development partnership in its future relations with Caribbean Community (CARICOM) member states. Nearly 400,000 permanent residents of Canada were born in one of the CARICOM states and a further 9,000 CARICOM nationals come to Canada each year under temporary worker programs."},

Policy coherence within the global health governance system is not evolving fast enough to ensure that trade and development issues related to public health, particularly concerning access to medicines, are effectively aligned at national, regional and multilateral levels. The paper briefly reviews the WTO Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement and the 2001 Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health. A case study outlines the manner in which \"TRIPS-plus\" provisions in selected US free trade agreements (FTAs) have undermined multi-level policy coherence in trade, development and public health. The discussion then identifies three unique governance mechanisms of the G8 that make the group a potentially powerful catalyst for innovation in global health governance, and assesses the opportunities that the 2008 G8 Hokkaido Summit may offer. The paper concludes by offering recommendations for enhancing multi-level policy coherence and for strengthening the system of global health governance."},

Furthermore, the Caribbean nations' ability to sustain a high level of social well-being is suffering due to the effects of broader economic change that has left the region in a reactive position. Against this backdrop, the services sector in the Caribbean may serve as an important source of economic growth, but only if the region begins to move beyond tourism to take advantage of emerging opportunities in the areas of banking and financial services, call centres and information and communication technology, off-shore education and health services, and transportation. This essay assesses the future prospects for the Caribbean to create a thriving service-based economy and offers ideas to help the region to both build on and transcend its reliance on tourism to carve a more profitable and sustainable niche in the global economy."},

Canada has developed a number of formal links with the Middle East, most notably a free trade agreement with Israel, and a number of bilateral tax agreements, but there is room to secure further formal links to the region and to foster trade more generally. These formal and informal relationships, accompanied by enhanced strategic governmental contacts and more savvy efforts by Canadian businesses, would likely be rewarded by substantially higher levels of business activity, particularly with the Gulf states."},
{"title": "Celebrity Diplomacy and the G8: Bono and Bob as Legitimate International Actors", "authors": ["Andrew F. Cooper"], "publishing_date": "2007-09-15T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "The last decade has seen an increased accumulation of media snapshots of celebrity activism on the international stage, to a point where world leaders scramble to get access to figures like Bono and Bob Geldof. This paper argues that the global capabilities of celebrity diplomats should not be undervalued or dismissed. Where traditional sites of statecraft, such as the Group of Eight (G8), face a myriad of challenges of legitimacy and efficiency, a new type of transnational advocate has surfaced - one in which movie stars, musicians and CEOs have eased into quite dramatically. Their ability to gain extended face time with prominent national leaders, while their message is heard at both the mass and elite levels, means that they are engaging in the kind of widespread communication that underpins successful diplomacy. This paper demonstrates that above all others, Bono and Bob Geldof have become significant, ascendant diplomatic actors in a global system that is open to their inclusion in ways that very few would have anticipated."},
{"title": "Brain Drain, Brain Circulation, Remittances and Development Prospects for the Caribbean", "authors": ["Laura Dawson"], "publishing_date": "2007-06-24T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "The issue of brain drain as a result of South-North migration has been a preoccupation for developing countries around the world and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) states in particular. In recent years, the debate has moved beyond brain drain to speculate on the development prospects of brain circulation through return migration. Also on the current agenda are the prospects for economic development through remittances and the engagement of diaspora communities. This paper examines the evolution of the debate and key issues with particular attention to the implications for small, developing states within CARICOM. Of particular importance is the conclusion that remittances alone are not sufficient for economic development and are, in fact, a reverse subsidy to wealthier countries. However, through domestic reforms and international advocacy and cooperation it may be possible to improve the development returns of highly skilled emigration."},
{"title": "Higher Education Reservations and India's Economic Growth: An Examination", "authors": ["Gurpreet Mahajan"], "publishing_date": "2008-09-06T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "In 2006 the Indian parliament passed legislation reserving an additional 27 percent of seats in all institutions of higher learning, funded by the central government, for the category of socially disadvantaged groups officially known as \"Other Backward Classes.\" At a time when India is opening its economy to global competition, this initiative has re-ignited the debate on the efficacy of reservations and triggered fresh anxieties about the impact of this policy on India's economic growth. This paper looks closely at the offered justifications for this policy as well as the expressed concerns. While examining the implications of the policy, particularly the claim that higher education reservations will dilute the quality of human capital, the paper suggests that the policy may present long-term challenges not currently anticipated. The argument rests on the understanding that while educational institutions must be responsive to the concerns of marginalized groups, the policies for correcting prevailing exclusions must be just and fair. If they enshrine identity as a permanent economic asset or a source of ever-renewable privilege, these policies are likely to produce social conflict and disharmony. This element is ignored by the announced policy and is likely to weaken not just India's educational institutions but also its democracy - results that are likely to weaken India's prospects of becoming a global power and its goal of social equity."},
{"title": "Fragile Stability: Post-Apartheid South Africa", "authors": ["Hany Besada"], "publishing_date": "2007-08-15T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "Despite the international recognition and praise that South Africa received in 1994 for organizing its first free and fair, multiracial presidential elections, the country continues to exhibit increasing signs of state fragility on a number of different fronts that could be traced back to the economic, social and political legacies of Apartheid. Primarily, this paper analyzes some immediate social and economic challenges facing the country in its transitional period. With the collapse of Apartheid, the country has largely achieved racial peace, but not social harmony. Although some progress has been made with regard to spurring economic growth and instituting painful macroeconomic stabilization policies, the plight of its black majority remains bleak as it had been under white rule. Unless social and economic reforms are sped up, South Africa's achievements over the past 13 years will be undermined by the brewing dissatisfaction and frustration with the government's handling of the economy and its attempts in addressing the social ills of Apartheid that still haunt it."},
{"title": "Egypt's Constitutional Test: Averting the March toward Islamic Fundamentalism", "authors": ["Hany Besada"], "publishing_date": "2007-08-20T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "After gaining overwhelming support in a March 2007 national referendum, long-time Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak introduced new constitutional amendments that effectively give more power to the president and loosen controls on security forces. Mubarak's amendments constitute the latest move in a set of orchestrated plans not only to entrench the stronghold of his own National Democratic Party and pave the way for his son as his successor but also to curb the power and ambition of his greatest opposition - the Muslim Brotherhood. As he steps into his fifth consecutive six-year term in office, Mubarak and his regime are being met with harsh criticism as opposition groups, human rights advocates and Western governments urge for meaningful democratic reform in the country. But promoting democracy is a complex issue in Egypt, and indeed in much of the Arab world. Mubarak and other leaders face the Islamist Dilemma, where any move toward a more democracy-friendly political system threatens to empower Islamic militants and open the floodgates for non-secular political parties."},
{"title": "Can the Trading System be Governed? Institutional Implications of the WTO's Suspended Animation", "authors": ["Robert Wolfe"], "publishing_date": "2007-09-20T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "Do the difficulties in reaching an agreement in the Doha round signal the need for institutional reform of the World Trade Organization (WTO)? Members face great difficulty in undertaking needed renovations and new agreements through negotiations, even as the organization goes about its daily work as usual. This paper is structured by two hypotheses: that the way in which interests are aggregated changes outcomes; and that deliberation aids learning, which changes outcomes. The paper shows that WTO decision-making principles, dominated by the Single Undertaking and consensus , are essential given the nature of the membership and the political saliency of the issues, which has implications both for what is discussed (the agenda) and how (process). New rules apply to all, which means that voice for all members matters. While exit is difficult, any member can deny consensus, in principle if not in practice, which creates more roles for small groups and coalitions, and a common need for transparency. The paper concludes that procedural improvements by themselves will not solve intractable policy disagreements, but the lessons now being learned in the Doha Round on how to manage traditional negotiations involving many more members within a changing global power structure might pay off in a subsequent round. Nevertheless the engagement of thousands of officials in the WTO process continues to shape collective management of the global trading system, even when revisions to the treaty prove elusive."},

The EU's motives for advancing interregional negotiations with the GCC have not been primarily focused on creating trade, which is argued to be relatively limited for the EU. Instead, the EU's motives for continuing negotiations with the GCC are explained by the EU's geopolitical and ideational interests and to a lesser extent by interest group influences. We do not find, however, strong evidence of EU bureaucratic motives to negotiate with the GCC. Based on these findings, this paper suggests that the recent reawakening of EU-GCC negotiations can be explained by the relative increase in the geopolitical importance of the Gulf."},
{"title": "Science and Technology Policies, National Competitiveness, and the Innovation Divide", "authors": ["Carin Holroyd"], "publishing_date": "2007-10-20T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "The rapid and unprecedented reorientation of the global economy in recent decades has compounded the importance of national competitiveness and innovation strategies. Governments play a critical role in promoting science and technology, as innovation requires a level of investment not easily derived from the private sector. With much of the world's manufacturing shifting to Asia, political support in industrialized countries has moved away from heavy industry in favour of nanotechnology, biotechnology, digital enterprises and alternative energy solutions. This paper comments on the existing methods of analyzing national science and technology policies, and makes an assessment of the innovation strategies adopted by three very different countries - Japan, Canada and Nigeria. In particular, it illustrates how nations at varying stages of development have responded to modern scientific and technology opportunities and challenges. The paper concludes that the widening \"digital divide\" requires a significant response from governments and international institutions in order to create greater and more equitable global prosperity."},

Consensus among all stakeholders is that priority must be given to the development of cellulosic ethanol and other technologies capable of delivering a safe and effective biofuel, to address the growing US energy security dilemma. The development of a new biofuels market that will combine ethanol production from traditional and innovative crops with new alternative fuel technology presents exciting opportunities and challenges. This paper examines the current developments in the ethanol market - both economic and political - and attempts to show where the synergies lie between US producers' best strategies and achieving energy security."},

Over its 32-year history, this elite forum of democratic industrialized countries has shown its ability to accommodate change, but it is rooted in an earlier era, and the growing power shift in global relations toward emerging market countries has not been reflected in either its scope or its membership. In recent years there has been a plethora of proposals to reform the club, from narrowing its brief to having it to coexist with a new and more representative body, and from membership expansion to complete abolition. To appreciate the full extent of this set of debates, this paper looks back at the origins of the summit and its intended architecture. It then reviews and analyses actual and proposed reforms over the summit's history, from early pressures to modify the original G5 through current attempts to move beyond the G8 to a Leaders' 20 (L20) or perhaps a group of 14."},
{"title": "Technology Upgrading and China's Growth Strategy to 2020", "authors": ["John Whalley", "Weimin Zhou"], "publishing_date": "2007-03-20T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "It is widely believed in China that in order to meet the target of tripling gross domestic product (GDP) per capita between 2005 and 2020, as set out in China's eleventh five-year plan in 2005, a change in China's growth strategy from FDI promotion and export-led growth towards technology upgrading and higher productivity growth in manufacturing needs to occur. This paper seeks to evaluate the potential effectiveness of recent government initiatives to be taken to achieve these ends. In particular, these include increased educational spending, tax incentives, large research and development (R&D) projects, and changes to the regulatory environment. In measuring China's economic growth potential towards 2020, this paper employs an economic analysis of Total Factor Productivity and identifies the importance of continued domestic technical innovation."},

This paper measures the progress of corporate governance reforms in nine East Asian economies towards the guidelines established by the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC), as revealed empirically through two surveys. The first survey is a stock-taking exercise to take note of ongoing reforms in corporate governance rules and regulations, while the second covers perceptions of the implementation and enforcement of corporate governance rules as seen by fund managers and analysts. This study indicates a divergence between the regulatory environment and market perceptions of corporate governance practices in the countries sampled. The survey results also show that, although the nine economies do not differ significantly in the corporate governance rules and regulations they have put in place, there is a significant difference in terms of market perceptions of their corporate governance practices. More than an academic exercise, this study is meant to share the experiences of corporate governance reform among East Asian economies."},

This paper examines the nature of the emerging economic relationship between Latin America and the Caribbean and China, and seeks to offer some reflections on the significance of this relationship for Latin American and Caribbean development. It begins with an overview of trade and investment relationships between Latin American countries and China, and examines the significance of the emergence of China for the region's development strategies and developmental prospects in greater detail. This paper reflects on the early impact of these emerging arrangements on the existing economic relationship between Latin America and the United States, and seeks in some ways to challenge understandings of this sort based on national economies and instead argues for a focus on global production and value chains, as well the new transnational division of labour."},

Cooper", "Timothy Shaw"], "publishing_date": "2006-12-03T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "Continuing CIGI's BRICSAM research, this paper questions whether the size (economic or population) of emerging economies alone is enough to warrant accommodation in the rules and structures of the international system. The global realignment of states following the power vacuum brought on by the end of the Cold War is finally materializing, as a new triangular formation has taken shape: the \"first world\" club of the OECD; the \"second world\" of emerging economies; and, a heterogeneous \"third world\" of the rest. The interplay between and mobility among these groups of states deserves in-depth analysis. The core of this paper observes the economic and social trends of countries in the second tier, and their upwards aspirations towards the top tier of the global architecture. Traced through a variety of indices, the growth of the BRICSAM group of countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, ASEAN-4 and Mexico) is demonstrated to be a powerful force in international economics and political economy. For the inclusion of these states, a change in the key aspects of global economic governance, the international architecture and geopolitics seems inevitable, and with it, new challenges arise for decision makers and scholars alike."},
{"title": "On the Manner of Practising the New Diplomacy", "authors": ["Jorge Heine"], "publishing_date": "2006-10-19T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "The traditional model of diplomacy, founded on the principles of national sovereignty and of statecraft, is becoming less relevant as a field of new, influential actors enter the international system. Diplomats must now engage a vastly larger number of players in host countries, as the age-old \"club model\" of diplomacy gives way to a less hierarchical \"network model.\" This paper calls for a new approach - one in which diplomats project their nation's values and interests to the growing field of international players, focusing on a critical set of issue areas of special relevance to the mission. Although the environment in which diplomacy is practiced has changed drastically, the adaptive behaviour of many diplomats and foreign ministries has not always kept pace with this new reality. This is part of the reason they are not fully able to take advantage of the many new opportunities offered by increased international flows and interactions. Drawing on the author's diplomatic experience in South Africa and India, it is argued that diplomats are no longer sheltered from the political realm; that they are more accessible by and have a wider access to non-state actors; and that they must respond to the vast array of demands these new factors pose."},

{"title": "Stretching the Model of \"Coalitions of the Willing\"", "authors": ["Andrew F. Cooper"], "publishing_date": "2005-10-07T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "Two models may be drawn up of coalitions of the willing. The first model is epitomized by the group of countries assembled by the United States for the mobilization of the 2003 Iraq war. The second model is the form of coalition associated with the anti-personnel landmines campaign and the initiative on the International Criminal Court in the mid- to late-1990s. This paper will explore the relationship between these different types of coalitions. The former type is characterized by a top-down, state-centric and coerced/opportunistic strategic form. The latter type by way of contrast takes a bottom-up, voluntary, mixed actor, diplomatic approach. Yet, alongside these differences are some striking, but unanticipated similarities. Most dramatically, both types have been assembled on an intense stylistic basis with an eye to avoiding the frustrations associated with working via established institutions. By looking more closely at the external expression and inner workings of these modes of activity, the model of coalitions of the willing is stretched out in terms of their motivations, sense of ownership and future trajectory."},
{"title": "Great Expectations: Mexico's Short-Lived Convergence under NAFTA", "authors": ["Carol Wise"], "publishing_date": "2007-01-19T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "Upon Mexico's entry into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), neo-classical trade theory assumed, first, that it had the greatest potential for higher rates of growth, productivity and overall welfare gains due to its relatively underdeveloped status; and, second, that Mexico's adjustment to an integrated, liberal economy would be the most painful but also the most beneficial. It was envisioned that the blending of Mexico's endowment factors - cheap labour, natural resources and proximity to the US market - with the abundant capital and advanced technology of Canada and the US would maximize on NAFTA's competitive potential over the long-term. However, these expectations have yet to fully materialize. This paper reviews the convergence/divergence debate with regard to NAFTA and Mexico, and analyzes the empirical data that have been used to tout both the benefits and the costs of asymmetrical integration. In light of the standstill in Mexico's per capita growth since 2001, this paper concludes with a critique of the potential role of NAFTA as a development tool and argues that the steep regional asymmetries call for a more proactive continental strategy."},

Crisis and Reform at the IMF", "authors": ["Bessma Momani", "Eric Helleiner"], "publishing_date": "2007-02-12T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "Top policy makers worry today that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) risks \"slipping into obscurity.\" What explains the IMF's declining influence? Two significant developments have been the declining demand for IMF loans from middle-income borrowers, and the emergence of a more critical view towards the institution from US policy makers in recent years. In this new political context, a range of reform proposals has been put forward by Fund management, key shareholders and the concerned policy community, with the goal of restoring and preserving the IMF's significance. Advocates of change have focused particular attention on the need for process-oriented reforms that would change the nature of IMF governance as a means of restoring its legitimacy among many member governments. Also prominent have been more outcome-oriented reforms that propose various changes in IMF activities and performance. A reinvigorated IMF is unlikely to emerge from the current situation without the implementation of governance-related reforms."},

His thesis is that the Iraq War has complicated the international community's efforts to fashion a robust collective response to the nuclear challenge posed by Iran. The war's legacies include diminished Western credibility in highlighting an Iranian threat, narrower policy options in responding to the nuclear challenge, and an Iran that is simultaneously politically stronger in Iraq, richer due to rising oil prices and more emboldened and motivated on national security."},

Three broad issues are considered. The first is the extent to which WTO accession helps China in dealing with various key trade issues, including anti-dumping and the textiles and apparel trade. The second is China’s participation in regional trade agreements post WTO accession. The third is the implementability of China’s accession commitments in key service areas (banking, insurance, telecoms). The issues now for China are less the merits of WTO accession, and rather its trade policy decisions given WTO membership."},
{"title": "The Asian Economic Revolution and Canadian Trade Policy", "authors": ["John Whalley"], "publishing_date": "2006-08-20T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "This paper discusses the broad orientation of Canada's trade policy relative to two major historical phases of development based on a secure national market behind the National Policy from 1879 until the 1930s, and progressive integration with the United States (US) through Bilateral Agreements (1930s), the Auto Pact (1965), the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement (1987) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) (1994). Currently, Canada exports approximately 85 percent to the US, but imports from China account for eight percent and are growing at over 20 percent a year. Sharply unbalanced (surplus) trade with the US is counterbalanced by unbalanced deficit trade with China. A scenario of elevated growth in Asia (principally China, India and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN) poses challenges of relative disintegration from North America and growing global integration centered on Asia. Seemingly, a series of implications follow, including positioning Canada within the emerging network of regional agreements in Asia, more resource-based and Western Canada focused trade and infrastructure development, and responding to capital market integration with Asia. Broader issues include the potential adjustments facing Central Canada as Asian imports of manufactures displace both imported manufactures from the US and domestic production are raised."},

It then critically assesses how divergences play out in the key policy areas of water exports, generic drugs, textile quotas, service-sector liberalization and agricultural subsidies. Lastly, it will try to answer the question of whether Doha is \"a sure bet, or a train wreck\" by looking at several of the prospects and possible scenarios that face the WTO post-Hong Kong. What is now evident is that a target deal seems more distant than ever."},

But developing countries were frustrated with both the process and the content of the agricultural agreement negotiations early on in the Round. This prompted these countries, through a number of developing country groupings such as the G20 and others, to call for changes in the talks to ensure that developing country voices and concerns were heard. Though developing countries were in many ways successful in registering their concerns in the latter half of the negotiations and have maintained a fairly high degree of cohesion across the Global South, it remains unclear whether this cohesion will last as the uneven impacts of agricultural trade liberalization become apparent."},

Concerns about supply interruptions and rising prices sped approval of an energy bill which Congress had in the works for nearly five years. Moreover, the growing prominence of the nation's energy challenges drew special attention from President Bush in his 2006 State of the Union Address, sparking a renewed search for viable alternative fuels. Of those, ethanol is receiving the lion's share of attention. This paper will argue that the new US focus on energy alternatives will undoubtedly impact the ethanol and agricultural markets. However, this discussion will also advance the notion that a key element of an effective ethanol strategy from both cost and environmental perspectives lies in forging technological and open trading relationships in the Western Hemisphere, particularly with Brazil and Canada."},

{"title": "The Unified Enterprise Tax and SOEs in China", "authors": ["John Whalley", "Li Wang "], "publishing_date": "2007-04-02T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "Proposals are actively circulating in China to move to a unified enterprise tax structure with similar tax treatment of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), other private enterprises (OPEs) and foreign investment enterprises (FIEs). FIEs presently receive significant tax preferences through a sharply lower tax rate, tax holidays and other provisions. Here we use analytical representations of SOE behaviour, which differ from that of the competitive firm, to argue that a unified tax structure may not be a desirable tax change and that typically a higher tax rate on SOEs is called for on efficiency grounds. Using a worker control model with endogenously determined shirking, taxes on SOEs reduce shirking and a reduced SOE tax rate under a unified tax relaxes discipline on SOEs and losses result. Our results indicate a 0.26% of GDP welfare loss using 2004 data from a unified tax, and larger loss relative to an optimal tax scheme. Alternatively, if we use a managerial control model variant, we find a 0.19% welfare loss from a unified tax, and larger losses relative to initial higher SOE tax rates."},

Kumar"], "publishing_date": "2007-02-22T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "Since 1999, all concessional lending by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) must be targeted at poverty reduction. The paper critically examines the design and implementation of the IMF's poverty reduction initiative by focusing on the operations of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). The data relating to the lending activity of the facility, coupled with an econometric explanation of the size of a PRGF arrangement in terms of key macro-economic variables, reveal some surprises. Not only does the lending activity of the new facility not appear to be much different - in frequency, size or total lending - than that under the Structural Adjustment Facility or Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF/ESAF), but the average lending to individual countries over the period 2000-2004 is also inversely related to the human poverty index. At a time when IMF is quickly losing its traditional clientele, such findings raise doubts about the Fund's efficacy in administering development finance."},

In contrast to its earlier years, the IMF today exists in an international environment populated by a wide variety of public and private sector international institutions that compete with and complement the work done by the IMF. A key factor in the IMF's performance and future prospects is its relationship with these institutions. This paper analyzes institutional developments in the IMF's environment, linking these with broader contemporary social trends, and drawing conclusions about the significance of these developments for IMF reform. These social trends include a shift from hierarchies to networks, a recognition of the socially constructed character of knowledge and the growing importance of this knowledge relative to material resources, and a shift from a reliance on US hegemony to multilateralism. The paper argues that the IMF has taken some modest steps in its work to include these considerations and enhance its relationship with other institutions, but these elements need to be included in the process of IMF reform to a much greater degree. The author argues for a focus on global production and value chains, as well the new transnational division of labour."},
{"title": "Enduring Political Divides in South Africa", "authors": ["Hany Besada"], "publishing_date": "2007-04-02T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "This paper offers an assessment of the foreign policy strategies adopted by both the Mandela and Mbeki administrations in their quest to shed the country's image as a former defender of racial segregation, largely dislocated from the global economic system to become the leading defender of multiparty democracy, national reconciliatory processes and economic justice in Sub-Saharan Africa. In detail, it examines the five strategies employed by the ANC government to restore peace and stability to the country while paving a new path for it to embark on as a respected member of the international community. These include the restoration of a political system based on pluralism, democratic institutions and a new constitution that enshrines the importance of human rights and equality; a well organized process of national reconciliation deemed necessary to heal some of the outstanding perpetual scars of Apartheid; self promotion as the leader of the \"African renaissance\"; adherence to the foreign policy principle of \"universality\"; assumption of a leadership role in international organizations; and a new shift towards self-driven policy to secure economic interests deemed vital for the national economy. While it reflects some of the foreign policy challenges confronting countries on the sub-continent, it also offers insights into the foreign policy adaptation strategies pursued by emerging powers in other regions of the world."},
{"title": "Regional Monetary Arrangements in ASEAN+3  as Insurance through Reserve Accumulation and Swaps", "authors": ["John Whalley", "OG Dayaratna-Banda"], "publishing_date": "2007-04-12T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "East Asia is witnessing the emergence of an informal monetary system which focuses on self-insurance, through its own reserve accumulation, and co-insurance, through swaps. The former is concentrated in a small number of large countries (China, Japan and Korea), while the latter involves informal monetary cooperation among monetary authorities in a large number of countries. The origins of this system lie in the Asian financial crises, and reflect concerns both to avoid repetition of similar events and any spread of further crises through contagion effects. This paper first characterizes and documents this emerging system, describing how it works and what its objectives are, and then discusses its performance, its incompleteness, and assesses the system's ability to move towards deeper integration without adopting a single monetary authority as well as the impediments it faces. What is clear is that this type of system among individual countries is incomplete and falls well short of complete monetary integration, but at present it performs well even if it experiences a number of deficiencies. Most countries seem better off with partial reserve pooling, while incremental gains from higher degrees of pooling in the region tend to be small."},

Although many specifics have yet to be determined, some contours of this new trade policy landscape are coming into focus and in this short paper I examine their implications for the European Union's external commercial policy. Particular attention is given to both the state of business-government relations and the propensity to liberalize under the auspices of reciprocal trade agreements by Brazil, India and China - the potential new poles of the world trading system. I consider the likely consequences of these developments, plus factors internal to both the European Union and the United States, for the possible content of future multilateral trade initiatives."},

Since the end of the ATC, there has been a growing and spreading set of trade restrictions targeted primarily at China, the largest shipper of textile and apparel, through a series of agreements that we term China Containment Agreements. We discuss the evolution of these agreements, their behavioural responses, and then draw their parallels to those under the older MFA. We argue that there is potential for these restrictions to prolong and grow, as well as to spread to other products through the product-specific safeguards mechanism included in the conditions of China's World Trade Organization accession."},
{"title": "Sustainability of Economic Growth in India", "authors": ["Amitendu Palit", "Rajiv Kumar ", "Karan Singh"], "publishing_date": "2007-05-20T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "The robust performance of the Indian economy in recent years, with economic growth averaging 8.5 percent, has generated intense debate regarding India's future economic prospects. Indeed, the future of more than a billion people, many of whom still exist in degrading and unacceptable poverty and deprivation, depends critically on India's ability to grow at high rates. This paper, while examining the issue, argues that India's recent economic performance is a result of entering a virtuous circle of growth generated by some key structural drivers. The latter include a dynamic private sector, benign external environment and a well-functioning democracy. The paper also points out that high growth can be sustained only if necessary policies are adopted for removing binding constraints like poor infrastructure, stagnant agriculture and lack of fiscal space. The paper identifies education as the most critical sector requiring reforms, followed by public goods delivery and labour markets."},

This paper examines three key policy agendas that have emerged to drive, guide and inform this process: competitiveness, diplomacy and governance. In each case the paper first provides an overview of the main issues, setting the particular circumstances of the Commonwealth Caribbean within wider global developments. It then examines the current \"state of play\" in each area, highlighting progress made and problems encountered. The last part discusses policy issues in each area, identifying both key concerns in current policy and urgent policy questions that still remain to be resolved. The paper concludes that real progress can be made only if the Commonwealth Caribbean adopts the \"functional equivalent\" at the regional level of the kind of \"development state\" that was so successful in East Asia. This will involve restructuring CARICOM to become more innovative, proactive and directive than has been the case to date."},

{"title": "Anatomy of a Fallacy: The Senlis Council and Narcotics in Afghanistan", "authors": ["Frédéric Grare"], "publishing_date": "2008-02-20T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "Supplying the majority of the heroin consumed in Europe and nearly all consumed in Russia, Afghanistan's booming illicit drug market has not only entirely distorted the Afghan economy but also corrupted the country's nascent, fragile political system. While current norms regulating the production and traffic of illicit drugs have established the framework of an international prohibition regime, the policies associated with this regime have so far failed to stop or significantly slow the growing of Afghan opium. In 2005, in response to this situation, the Senlis Council, an international drug policy think tank, proposed the creation of a licensing system in Afghanistan which would allow the cultivation of opium for the production of essential medicines such as morphine and codeine. This system is intended to break the vicious circle of the drug economy by moving the opium trade into a legal system controlled by, and benefiting, the state. This paper adopts a critical view of the Senlis proposals, arguing that their underlying principles - economic, social and political - diverge only marginally from those underpinning previous approaches and have little potential for success under current political conditions. The paper concludes that, despite many imperfections, the current policies in place may be optimum given both Afghanistan's present situation and the structural problems inherent in the global war against drugs."},
{"title": "Building Intellectual Property Coalitions for Development", "authors": ["Peter K.

This paper, released on the eve of the 2008 General Assembly of WIPO in Geneva on September 22-30, argues that developing countries can improve their influence in international negotiations around intellectual property by coordinating their efforts and building coalitions. Establishment of such Intellectual Property Coalitions for Development (IPC4D) could reduce the push by the European Community and the United States to ratchet up global intellectual property standards in the face of opposition from many developing countries. If successful, such efforts could enlarge the policy space that these countries need for the development of their intellectual property, trade and public health policies."},

Triggered in part by the Mugabe government's decision to ignore fiscal constraints, and exacerbated by increased social unrest and ballooning inflation, Zimbabwe's economic performance lags far behind that of neighbouring South Africa or Zambia. Miraculously, Zimbabwe has managed to avoid falling into complete collapse - the result of low but consistent levels of foreign direct investment, official development assistance and strong Sino-Africa relations. This paper surveys Zimbabwe's economic crisis, and discusses some of the factors impeding the country's downfall. It concludes with recommended areas of focus for economic recovery."},
{"title": "Public Sector Reform in the Commonwealth Caribbean: A Review of Recent Experiences", "authors": ["Paul Sutton"], "publishing_date": "2008-10-25T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "The importance of an efficient and effective public service in the delivery of economic and social development is a long-standing theme of development policy. To this end, comprehensive public sector reform has become a major feature in many developing countries in recent years. This paper examines the recent experience of the Commonwealth Caribbean with a particular focus on the successes and failures of New Public Management (NPM) as a strategy for reform. It begins by briefly examining the institutional environment that has shaped public administration and public management in the Commonwealth Caribbean and then examines some of the principal ideas behind NPM, distinguishing it from the previous dominant paradigm of development administration. The paper then identifies three key issues that have emerged in the reform process: the political-administrative interface; the private sector as a model for the public sector; and the human resource dimension of managing change. In each case the background to reform is given along with the NPM solution to the problem and a case study exemplifying how it has worked out in practice. The paper concludes by discussing two key dimensions of the NPM experience: its internationalization and the importance of politics in promoting and sustaining a successful public sector reform program. Te final section examines some of the main lessons of reform and what direction it might take in the future."},
{"title": "China's Role as a Trade Bridge for Expanding Regional and World Trade", "authors": ["Min Gong ", "Wenpu Li"], "publishing_date": "2008-10-28T00:00:00Z", "abstract": "This paper investigates China's trade interactions with the United States, Japan and South Korea from the period of the first quarter of 1993 to the fourth quarter of 2005. It finds substantial Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)-induced indirect trade from Japan and Korea to the US through China, and between Japan and Korea through China. These indirect trade flows have led to increases in China's trade deficit with Japan and Korea as well as China's trade surplus with the US. The indirect trade flows through China also indicate the importance of China's role as a trade bridge. From the viewpoint of world trade growth, as a trade bridge, China contributes to the stable growth of the regional and world economies. However, playing this role as a trade bridge may negatively affect China's long-term economic growth."},

The areas he considers are the safety of nuclear power plants, radioactive waste management, research reactors, radioactive sources, emergency preparedness and response, and nuclear security. From here the author examines how four different states - Australia, Brazil, Canada and Jordan - have dealt domestically with their international legal obligations relating to such matters. The author concludes by recommending ways to strengthen and integrate the regimes to better cope with the expected global revival in peaceful applications of nuclear energy."},

Those in the region looking to harness the power of the diaspora have turned their attention to the example of Ireland, a country with a large diaspora that has contributed significantly to its national advancement. By highlighting the lessons of the Irish experience, this paper argues that while the Caribbean's diaspora has the desire to contribute and does help through remittances, there remain a number of challenges to this participation including perceptions of security and stability, establishing the conditions necessary for attracting investment and a lack of confidence in government institutions in the region."},

In the Soviet Union, nuclear energy served as a symbol of technological progress and scientific achievement in the country's rivalry with the West. However, the march of Soviet nuclear progress was brought to a halt by the nuclear accident involving a Soviet-designed reactor at Chernobyl in 1986. After languishing for two decades, the nuclear industry in Russia has recently been greeted with renewed funding and enthusiasm. This paper explores the goals and challenges of the Russian nuclear power industry, discussing its status and prospects."},

While nuclear power has met about one fifth of UK electricity needs in the past decade, about one third of Britain's total electricity generating capacity is expected to need replacing over the next 20 years, partly because most existeing nuclear power stations will close. Concrns about security of supply and climate change frame the UK debate, and while the government has concluded that new nuclear build is a major part of any solution, public opinion remains deeply divided - not least because of the legacy of costly and inefficient former UK nuclear projects. This paper explores the status and prospects of the British nuclear industry, including its history, UK energy strategy and the evolving regulatory framework, and discusses the continuing concerns surrounding the prospective new nuclear build in the UK."},

This paper discusses the Canadian mining of uranium, its subsequent processing, current enrichment technologies and the capital and operating costs of a modern centrifuge enrichment plant. On the basis of these reasoned estimates based on publicly available information, it is expected that enrichment in Canada is likely to be more profitable than exporting natural uranium and buying back enriched uranium. Assuming that an environmentally and socially acceptable enrichment site is selected, this report asserts that an environmental assessment would be unlikely to find significant adverse effects."},

Before the ink was dry on the London Compact and the Afghan National Development Strategy, many observers were calling for course adjustments and policy reviews. Ambassador Ronald E. Neumann, in this first edition of CIGI’s Afghanistan Papers series, acknowledges the flaws in the current strategies for Afghanistan’s transition but calls for a greater focus on implementation. More attention must be dedicated to practical implementation issues such as stakeholder coordination and aid delivery structures. Changes in policy and strategy alone cannot subdue an insurgency or jumpstart a flagging state-building process; this will take a renewed focus on the authorities, practices and resources needed to produce substantive impacts on the ground. In surveying a broad range of critical issues from the development of the Afghan national security forces to good governance promotion, Neumann offers insights on how to improve policy implementation in Afghanistan."},

This paper critically examines the underlying assumptions behind these failing policies and explores alternative approaches to rescue Afghanistan’s war-to-peace transition. Faulty assumptions on the part of key US government advisors, decision makers and many of their Afghan and Pakistani clients have contributed to the resurgence of the Taliban and a crisis of trust for the Karzai government and the internationally supported state-building process.

{"title": "The Indian Nuclear Industry: Status and Prospects", "authors": ["M. V. Ramana"], "publishing_date": "2009-12-09T11:43:00Z", "abstract": "In September 2008, the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) offered a special waiver to India, exempting it from the nuclear export guidelines its members set for themselves. Under the terms of the waiver, usually referred to as the US-India deal, India was allowed to import nuclear reactors and other technology without becoming a party to the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). It was also allowed to import uranium for fueling those domestically constructed reactors that it put under international safeguards. This waiver has raised expectations of a tremendous increase in nuclear trade with India. To make sense of these expectations and the prospects for nuclear power in India, this report offers a historical overview and assessment of the Indian nuclear industry, including India’s indigenous efforts and the role of foreign aid and expertise. The assessment points to some successes in India’s nuclear energy program, but notes significant safety concerns, high costs, and a limited production of energy. The author concludes that nuclear energy will remain an important part of India’s energy plan, but notes that even under the conditions of the waiver, its contribution will remain modest for decades to come."},

Its basic structure and mandate build directly on those of its predecessor, the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), an institution that did not live up to the hopes of many of its founders. Will the FSB meet the same fate in its efforts to strengthen international prudential standards? Three features of the FSB will help it overcome some of the FSF's weaknesses: its larger membership addresses some of the FSF's legitimacy problems; it has been assigned more effective mechanisms to encourage compliance with international standards; and the FSB has been given a stronger capacity to tackle macroprudential issues. Each of these features also raises new challenges and priorities to be addressed: - With the FSB’s larger membership, the following should be encouraged: more focus on principles-based international standards rather than detailed rule-based ones; the strengthening of the voice of new developing country members within the institution; and further efforts to address its lack of accountability to non-members. - Each of the FSB’s four new mechanisms to strengthen compliance with international standards could be improved: the mandatory regular Financial Sector Assessment Programs (FSAPs) and publication of the detailed IMF/WB assessments related to the ROCSs for members; the new membership obligations to implement international standards; the new peer review process for FSB members; and the new FSB-led process to tackle non-cooperating jurisdictions. - The FSB’s capacity to tackle macroprudential issues could be strengthened 'by: clarifying the standard setting bodies’ (SSBs) accountability to the FSB; continuing to prioritize the creation of international standards for counter-cyclical regulation and the treatment of systematically important institutions, markets and instruments; and devoting more attention to the task of minimizing the risk of private sector capture of financial regulatory policy making. If these challenges and priorities are met successfully, the FSB will strengthen the institutional foundation of international regulatory cooperation. Rather than becoming a powerful international body, however, its role would remain primarily focused on facilitating transgovernmental networks, with ultimate responsibility for financial regulation and supervision still resting firmly at the national level (or perhaps at the regional level in the case of Europe)."},

In many cases, the Taliban have co-opted, in addition to bandits, disgruntled militia commanders previously linked to other organizations, and the relationship between them is far from solid. There is also, however, emerging evidence of grassroots recruitment of small groups of ideologically committed Uzbek, Turkmen and Tajik Taliban. While even in northern Afghanistan the bulk of the insurgency is still Pashtun, the emerging trend should not be underestimated."},

It asks which global problems could be on future agendas and how to achieve both effectiveness and legitimacy. It discusses the composition of the G20, working and coordination methods in the preparatory process, and effective outreach processes. The main conclusions are: • The G20 should limit the agenda to the financial crisis issues and contain the inevitable pressures to broaden the agenda by inviting other groups and organizations to provide recommendations for consideration at future G20 meetings. • Composition is an intractable problem, with no correct answer. Legitimacy and efficiency could be attained by the Europeans speaking with one voice rather than six or eight, while the host country invites two or three “guests.” • To reconcile the need for extensive preparation with the antipathy to formal bureaucracy, the G20 should set up a summit “non-secretariat.” This nimble, nonbureaucratic structure could be located for one year in the host country, headed by the G20 troika sherpas, with two being non-resident. • More systematic and structured consultations with non-G20 countries, civil society, parliamentarians, the policy research community and the private sector could add to legitimacy and effectiveness."},
{"title": "Obama's New Af-Pak Strategy: Can \"Clear, Hold, Build, Transfer\" Work?", "authors": ["C. Christine Fair"], "publishing_date": "2010-07-28T16:02:00Z", "abstract": "On entering the White House, US President Barack Obama aimed to put the war in Afghanistan at the forefront of his security agenda following eight years of neglect by a Bush administration preoccupied by the war in Iraq. The Obama administration spent nearly a year reviewing the situation in Afghanistan and vetting war options amid protracted interagency deliberation and partisan debate. By the end of 2009, President Obama affirmed his administration’s commitment to degrading the capabilities of terrorist groups ensconced in Afghanistan and Pakistan and announced that, by the end of July 2011, the US would begin a conditions-based transfer of responsibility to the Afghan government and security forces, enabling the United States to diminish its kinetic military activities in favour of a more “typical” presence with Washington continuing to providing development and economic assistance, plus training for military and civilian personnel. Thus the counter-insurgency mantra of “clear, hold and build” became, under Obama, “clear, hold, build and transfer.” This paper evaluates the viability of the “clear, hold, build and transfer” approach in light of the structural challenges to each element and the pressure to deliver results in a short time-frame amid difficult security conditions."},
{"title": "The G20 and the Post-Crisis Economic Order", "authors": ["Andrew F. Cooper", "Colin Bradford"], "publishing_date": "2010-06-10T16:57:00Z", "abstract": "The G20 leaders’ forum has proven effective at coordinating a global response to economic uncertainty. Its collective action in 2008-2009, the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, has helped to mitigate the size of the international economic crisis. With the initial shocks now passed, the G20 faces new challenges as it moves into the phase of post-crisis global economic management. This paper highlights the G20’s position in the international governance architecture. The paper first looks at “incompleteness” in the G20 process as it moves from the role of a “crisis buster” to that of a global economic “steering committee.” The paper then outlines the tests the G20 will face over the short to medium terms. The focus then shifts to ways of improving outreach to non-members and other stakeholders, and discusses concerns of internal disconnects within the G20 itself. The paper concludes that: • The G20 must quickly ensure that it does not lose the momentum gained in dealing with the crisis through 2008-2009. Summit leaders should solidify the forum’s role through swift action to prevent backsliding on promises as the immediate effects of the global crisis dissipate. • The G20 must promote equitable international economic arrangements that provide a larger voice and role for the major economies of the global South. This must include the G20’s own performance and extend to other international forums. • Avoiding internal fracturing will be essential if the G20 is to move forward. The spirit of mutual cooperation that helped spur the G20’s elevation from a grouping of finance ministers to a meeting of leaders at the summit level must be harnessed. Collective action and problem solving should be encouraged that transcends traditionally like-minded groups of countries. • To better promote and secure legitimacy, the G20 must reach out to non-member states and non-state actors, giving voice and consideration to their concerns. But this outreach must be done in a way that does not diminish the G20 as a relatively cohesive and effective small group."},

However, while the private security industry has a vital role to play in stabilizing the country, it has long functioned without effective government oversight. Haiti’s security sector reform (SSR) process has begun to address this shortcoming. The paper analyzes the current state of the private security industry in Haiti and the legal framework under which it operates, and makes recommendations for how a reformed legal and regulatory regime can guide the next phase of its development, based on interviews with owners and agents of private security companies, industry associations, senior Haitian police personnel, United Nations (UN) planners and parliamentary leaders. The paper concludes that genuine consultation and partnership between the government, industry and civil society is required, if SSR programs in Haiti and elsewhere are to successfully marshal private resources towards the public good."},

The story that unfolds in this paper does not bode well for such cooperation. It is a detailed account of the initiatives, led by the IMF, to address imbalances prior to the 2008 global financial crisis. Based on interviews with scores of policy makers who were involved in the initiatives, and on thousands of pages of confidential documents that have never been disclosed, it focuses on two undertakings: the Fund’s 2007 decision to strengthen its surveillance of exchange rates, which was aimed at prodding countries to take action when their currencies were seriously under- or overvalued and the multilateral consultations, in which the IMF convened representatives of five major economies to discuss plans for shrinking imbalances."},

The FSF has largely avoided the intense scrutiny and criticism that other institutions have come under since the eruption of the global financial crisis. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), the FSF's successor body, was viewed as a move towards putting in place the required mechanisms for ensuring the safety and soundness of the global financial system. Based on interviews with scores of policy makers who worked on the FSF and thousands of pages of previously undisclosed documents, this paper brings to light the failure of regulators to keep pace with the globalization of the financial system."},

This distress, in turn, makes it difficult for them to envision a stable future for their communitythat includes multi-ethnic collaboration. For this reason, the paper asserts that the international community, in collaboration with the GOR and survivor communities around Rwanda, should pursue new humanitarian exhumations. These exhumations should be mandated to positively identify the anonymous victims of the 1994 genocide and return any identified remains to their surviving families for reburial."},

The study identifies system-related, social and behavioural reasons that pregnant women present themselves at labour wards with unknown HIV status and do not receive testing and counselling, either during labour or following delivery. Using primarily qualitative methods, a descriptive study was conducted in two districts in southern Malawi.The barriers identified in the study compelled women to refuse testing, hide results or develop strategies to keep their HIV status unknown or undisclosed. Understanding the dynamics and cultural boundaries that limit women’s access to testing is essential to improving this gateway to prevention of mother-to-child transmission care."},

No single country has the ability or resources to fix things on its own — a near-unprecedented degree of collective action is required.

The two nations face similar challenges with respect to funding their armed forces and providing the military capabilities that will be required to deal with the future security environment. After examining the procurement processes utilized in each nation and discussing how they interact with their defence industries, some recommendations are provided on areas where cooperation between the two nations could be possible."},

It considers, in particular, the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, arguing that global currency markets remain dominated by the US dollar and a very few other global currencies. Such currencies make up the vast majority of spot trading, derivative trading and bond issuance. It is likely that the massive liquidity advantage that these currencies maintain is one driver for why emerging economies continue to find it economically efficient to issue external debt in foreign currency rather than in local currency."},

The maintenance of the EU’s “constructive ambiguity” approach to the question of Serbia’s recognition of Kosovo as an independent state is important for continued normalizing relations between the countries. The EU’s continuous and active involvement and interest in the region is of paramount importance for the full implementation of the agreement."},
{"title": "The Equator Principles: Ten Teenage Years of Implementation and a Search for Outcome", "authors": ["Olaf Weber", "Emmanuel Acheta"], "publishing_date": "2014-01-30T14:16:00Z", "abstract": "The Equator Principles (EPs) are codes of conduct for project finance on the sustainability impacts of a project and on the risk assessment procedures of financial institutions that have adopted the principles — Equator Principles Financial Institutions (EPFIs). The EPs were launched 10 years ago and have undergone three revisions, while the EPFIs have increased from 10 to 78 members in 2013. This paper correlates these 10 years of existence to the adolescent stage of the EPs, still seeking to establish relevance. Environmental and social assessment of projects is increasing in global adoption and scope and the EPs strive to redefine these assessment practices. Critics reason, however, that without implementation efforts and enforcement, the EPs are merely window dressing and will not contribute to any change to sustainable development. The authors point out gaps in how EPFIs address the implementation of guidelines in project finance decision making, how projects implement environmental and social assessment processes in practice and whether the implementation will have a positive effect on project sustainability. The paper concludes that these gaps need further research and analysis to better understand the role of the EPs in sustainable development."},
{"title": "Vertically Integrated Peace Building and Community Violence Reduction in Haiti", "authors": ["Timothy Donais", "Geoff Burt"], "publishing_date": "2014-02-04T16:00:00Z", "abstract": "Gang-driven violence in the urban slums of Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, has been a preoccupation of international peace-building efforts for the past decade, yet continues to pose a serious threat to peace and stability in the country. These communities have, in recent years, been the site of an ongoing series of experiments, involving a range of different actors, aimed at reclaiming them from armed gangs; however, the isolated and fragmented nature of these interventions has reduced their cumulative impact. This paper makes a case for greater coherence and coordination between bottom-up community violence reduction efforts and top-down police reform, based on a broader argument around the importance of “vertically integrated peace building.” Based on field interviews with community leaders as well as officials from both the UN and the Haitian government, this paper suggests that, in the public security realm as elsewhere, the careful integration of top-down and bottom-up efforts represents an important avenue for strengthening state-society relations, increasingly recognized as a crucial component of any sustainable peace-building process."},

This background paper explores the historical evolution of dairy in Canada, and why supply management was eventually implemented in the 1960s, bringing rationality and organization to an industry where none had existed before. It also examines the role of international trade negotiations, largely sponsored by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and, after 1995, by the World Trade Organization, in addressing issues of agricultural protectionism and exceptionalism. While supply management has been protected by Canadian governments, rising international pressure has led Canada to begin to reconsider its support, especially as bilateral trade negotiations and partners are unequivocally opposed to dairy supply management."},

McCauley"], "publishing_date": "2014-02-11T09:37:00Z", "abstract": "This paper analyzes the discussion of a substitution account in the 1970s and how the account might have performed had it been agreed in 1980. The substitution account would have allowed central banks to diversify away from the dollar into the IMF’s Special Drawing Right (SDR), comprised of US dollar, Deutschmark, French franc (later euro), Japanese yen and British pound, through transactions conducted off the market. The account’s dollar assets could fall short of the value of its SDR liabilities, and hedging would have defeated the purpose of preventing dollar sales. In the event, negotiators were unable to agree on how to distribute the open-ended cost of covering any shortfall if the dollar’s depreciation were to exceed the value of any cumulative interest rate premium on the dollar. As it turned out, the substitution account would have encountered solvency problems had the US dollar return been based on US treasury bill yields, even if a substantial fraction of the IMF’s gold had been devoted to meet the shortfall at recent high prices for gold. However, had the US dollar return been based on US treasury bond yields, the substitution account would have been solvent even without any gold backing."},
{"title": "The Big Break: The Conservative Transformation of Canada's Foreign Policy", "authors": ["John Ibbitson"], "publishing_date": "2014-04-07T10:26:00Z", "abstract": "In the years since the January 2006 election, Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s three Conservative governments have pursued a foreign policy so unlike what came before that it could be called the big break. The big break — or the Conservative transformation of Canada’s foreign policy — has been heavily criticized by academics, former diplomats, politicians and journalists, but it has also had a few defenders. This paper examines how the big break came about and what it looks like. It also seeks to place the transformation within the context of a foreign policy that was already in flux. The paper divides the arc of Canada’s engagement with the world from the end of World War II up until today into four  periods: Laurentian coherence; Laurentian incoherence; Conservative incoherence; and Conservative coherence. Future governments may seek to reverse this Conservative reversal of the Laurentian approach, but given the breadth and depth of the Conservative coalition, at least some of the big break is likely to endure."},

This paper examines how often members of the EP report and what content should be disclosed. Using institutional theory as the theoretical framework for the analysis, seven criteria (annual reporting, disclosure of screened transactions, the categorization of projects with respect to their assessment status, risk category, sector, region and implementation experience ) were used to test whether members report according to the EP’s guidelines.  While the majority of members report about risk categories, sectors and regions, only a minority report them in a way that enables readers to combine the figures and to analyze how risk occurs in certain regions and sectors. Because projects are not usually listed in a way that they are identifiable, the reports are non-transparent, making it impossible to allocate social and environmental impacts to certain projects, sectors and regions."},

It was the first time in nearly a decade that the topic attracted major international media attention. A key aspect of the post-WCIT discussion has centred on the role of “swing states” in this global debate. So far, most of this work has been based on predefined groups of countries or focused on countries based on anecdotal evidence of a vibrant tech community or existing relationships. The study discussed in this paper applied a more systematic approach. The research revealed some interesting patterns among certain groups of states. A core group of potential swing states — a total of 30 countries — are identified based on their voting behaviour at the WCIT, their various memberships and a range of relevant indicators. This list offers a road map for future in-depth studies. Ideally, it will also serve as a resource for practitioners and academics alike for comparison with current efforts and for future strategic planning that focuses on engaging other actors internationally. "},
{"title": "China's Goals in the G20: Expectation, Strategy and Agenda", "authors": ["Alex He"], "publishing_date": "2014-08-27T09:23:00Z", "abstract": "The G20 has emerged as the lynchpin of China’s involvement in global economic governance. It remains the only economic institutional setting where the country can operate on par with major Western powers. China has a strong interest in maintaining the status of the G20 as the premier forum for economic cooperation, and a vested interest in ensuring that the G20 does not degrade into yet another “talk shop” of multilateral diplomacy. However, the Chinese leadership’s current approach to the G20 is not driven by a desire to position the country as a leading agenda setter. Instead, China’s main policy priority is ensuring that the country is treated as an equal and respected partner. In the near future, China’s agenda in the G20 will continue to focus on financial issues, such as macroeconomic coordination and the reform of the international financial and monetary system; in particular, governance reform at the International Monetary Fund and having the renminbi placed in the special drawing right basket. China understands the advantages the G20 can provide as a platform for advancing these goals. Other agenda items, such as trade, energy, infrastructure investment financing and multilateral institutional financing will likely be given greater emphasis if China does host the G20 summit in 2016."},

{"title": "Sovereign Debt Restructuring: Old Debates, New Challenges", "authors": ["James A. Haley"], "publishing_date": "2014-05-29T13:16:00Z", "abstract": "Ten years ago, in the wake of the Asian financial crisis and subsequent Argentine default, the international community debated how to best promote the timely, effective restructuring of sovereign debt. It focused largely on the merits of a so-called statutory approach, versus the voluntary use of contractual terms designed to facilitate restructurings. This debate is once more on the international policy agenda and is again framed as statutory versus contractual approaches. This paper outlines the problems impeding timely sovereign debt restructurings, identifies the policy responses proposed and discussed 10 years ago in response to financial crises, and discusses the elements of old debates and how they can remain relevant in today’s new challenges. The paper concludes with three areas for further analysis: expanding the scope of contractual clauses that can help facilitate restructurings; accounting, tax and regulatory frameworks and identifying possible changes to remove impeding obstacles; and improving the process for negotiating debt restructurings, as well as creating a Sovereign Debt Forum for exchange of information."},
{"title": "Crisis Management  Mechanisms: Pathologies and Pitfalls", "authors": ["David A. Welch"], "publishing_date": "2014-09-04T14:00:00Z", "abstract": "As events demonstrate on a regular basis, the Asia-Pacific is a region prone to crisis. In recent years there has been a marked increase in the use of military force to signal interests or resolve, and even, in some cases, to alter the status quo, particularly in the East and South China Seas. Fortunately, none of these “mini crises” has escalated to the level of a shooting war. The received wisdom is that, all other things being equal, no country in the region desires conflict, owing to their high levels of economic interdependence. However, it is clear that in a context of rising nationalism, unresolved historical grievances and increasing hostility and suspicion, there is no reason to be complacent about the prospect of managing every future crisis successfully. Hence the recent surge in interest in crisis management “mechanisms” (CMMs). This paper explores the dangers of thinking of crisis management in an overly technical or mechanistic fashion, but also argues that sensitivity to those very dangers can be immensely useful. It draws upon US and Soviet experiences in the Cuban missile crisis to inform management of a hypothetical future Sino-American crisis in the East China Sea, and to identify general principles for designing and implementing CMMs."},
{"title": "The State-owned Enterprises Issue in China’s Prospective Trade Negotiations", "authors": ["Hejing Chen", "John Whalley"], "publishing_date": "2014-10-28T15:04:00Z", "abstract": "Over the next few years, China faces the prospect of major regional and bilateral trade negotiations. A likely key element in such negotiations is trade arrangements involving state-owned enterprises (SOEs). China is viewed from outside as having a large SOE sector, and large SOEs are viewed as having a protected monopoly position in domestic Chinese markets. This paper discusses some of the key sub-issues potentially arising with SOEs in these negotiations. These include: arrangements for SOEs under China’s antitrust laws as well as the operation of these arrangements in practice via case law, and how trade is affected by them; the potentially large increase in Chinese coverage of the World Trade Organization (WTO) government procurement code if Chinese SOEs were to be included under it; the implications of the changing relative size of SOEs and private sectors in China for the “non-market” economy (NME) designation, which China consented to upon WTO accession; and claimed subsidization of SOEs through various devices. The aim is to lay out a potential negotiating issues list for SOEs to better focus debate and outline possible approaches to accommodation, rather than definitively resolve the issues."},
{"title": "China and Sovereign Debt Restructuring", "authors": ["Hongying Wang"], "publishing_date": "2014-09-29T08:29:00Z", "abstract": "More than a decade after it put forth the idea of the Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism in the early 2000s, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is again seeking to engage various stakeholders in a new round of discussions about improving sovereign debt restructuring. As a major international creditor, China is an important force to reckon with, but thus far, its government has said little publicly regarding the recent IMF reports on this issue. Chinese policy makers and analysts are supportive of the IMF’s attempt to explore ways for earlier and more orderly debt restructuring, but they find the proposed reforms to be only marginally useful. This paper, by CIGI senior fellow Hongying Wang, contends that from China’s point of view, the most important question in debt management is how to prevent excessive borrowing and lending and reduce the likelihood of unsustainable debt. It sees discussions about the mechanisms of sovereign debt restructuring as having little effect on this question. As an international creditor, China’s main concern has to do with safeguarding the value of its overseas assets from the detrimental effect of macroeconomic policies of Western countries, especially the United States, and this issue that cannot be addressed by improved debt restructuring mechanisms. China remains deeply concerned about the power imbalance between developed and developing countries in the international financial system. Going forward in the global dialogue over sovereign debt restructuring, China’s priority will be to minimize international financial instability while protecting the development needs of developing countries. This paper offers a context for understanding China’s policy position, if and when it becomes official, by reviewing Chinese reactions to the last round of debate about sovereign debt restructuring in the early 2000s, and by examining recent Chinese discourse and initiatives regarding sovereign debt management."},

Siklos"], "publishing_date": "2014-09-30T15:12:00Z", "abstract": "China’s stock index futures (the CSI300) is the first market in mainland China where futures on Chinese stock indices can be bought. The CSI300 is a large market dominated by predominately private Chinese retail investors as opposed to institutional investors, which is rather atypical for an emerging market. This paper examines whether the introduction of the CSI300 had an impact on the volatility of the underlying spot market. Different varieties of Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models were estimated for mainland China and compared with the A50 and HSCEI spot and derivatives markets in Singapore and Hong Kong. At the same time, spillover effects between the three markets were modelled. Overall, we find robust evidence that the introduction of the CSI300 had a calming effect on the volatility of the CSI300 spot index, as well as on both the A50 and HSCEI spot markets. Differences in the types of investors, the tightly regulated nature of China’s futures market, together with the existence of two sister markets in the region where comparable stocks are traded, may well combine to explain why China’s market resembles its counterparts in mature economies more so than in emerging markets."},

This paper examines the reasons why China joined the G20 rather than the G8, and then focuses on a detailed review of China’s participation in G20 summits since the enhanced forum began in 2008. China took a very active and cooperative attitude in dealing with the global financial crisis in 2008-2009. The paper observes that China also insisted on its own agenda for reforms to the international monetary system, through reforms to the international financial institutions that manage it — in particular, raising the number of voting shares and the representation of developing countries at the IMF and the World Bank."},
{"title": "The Environmental Risk Disclosure Regime: Navigating Complexity in Global Financial Markets", "authors": ["Jason Thistlethwaite"], "publishing_date": "2014-10-29T09:58:00Z", "abstract": "In recent years, a plurality of different governance initiatives has emerged that are designed to expand the disclosure of environmental risk within financial markets. The emergence of these initiatives represents an important policy development, and it has the potential to reduce environmental risk within the financial sector by incentivizing investments in sustainable economic activity capable of long-term value creation. Unfortunately, environmental risk disclosure has yet to be assessed as a field of governance activity in addition to its potential effectiveness in improving disclosure within financial markets. Jason Thistlethwaite addresses this gap by describing environmental risk disclosure as a “regime complex,” defined by a field of fragmented but related governance initiatives that lacks an overarching hierarchy. While this regime complex does reveal evidence for policy convergence among different initiatives, it lacks the enforcement necessary to produce a coherent and comparable disclosure and contributes to uncertainty within the financial sector over the impact of environmental risk. The paper concludes that this uncertainty justifies an expanded role of international financial regulations in establishing a mandatory and harmonized disclosure standard that can be applied across different domestic jurisdictions."},

After exploring different understandings of peace building between these actors, this report ultimately argues that the United Nations fostered only weak vertical integration on the crucial issue of youth marginalization; that the lack of engagement leaves the peace vulnerable; and that deeper vertical integration can help ameliorate this ongoing challenge."},

However, much of the debate has been over aspects of privacy and security on the visible Web and there has not been much consideration of the governance of the “deep Web” and the “dark Web.” The term deep Web is used to denote a class of content on the Internet that, for various technical reasons, is not indexed by search engines. The dark Web is a part of the deep Web that has been intentionally hidden and is inaccessible through standard Web browsers.  The deep Web has the potential to host an increasingly high number of malicious services and activities.

However, with some exceptions, official and private sector actors from these countries still exhibit low levels of engagement with international financial standard setting. This is due to a combination of related factors: the continued focus of the Basel process on the ability and desire of an elite network of developed country regulators to set the agenda; a relative paucity of regulatory knowledge and resources in emerging countries; and low mobilization by emerging country private actors on BCBS proposals. It requires a set of measures to improve emerging country engagement, including bringing more development finance expertise into the Basel process, addressing the overrepresentation of European countries, further investments in regulatory knowledge and capacity, and actions in emerging and developing countries to improve transparency and public consultation in regulation."},

The adequacy of previous regimes of legal powers and governance arrangements is seriously challenged just at a time when the objective need for intelligence on the serious threats facing civil society is apparent.

This rapid increase in the volume of flows, accompanied by sharp swings in volatility, has amplified the complexity of macroeconomic management in emerging economies. This paper focuses on capital flows in selected emerging Asian economies, analyzing surge and stop episodes as well as changes in the composition of flows across these episodes, then evaluating the policy measures undertaken by these economies in response to the surge and stop of capital flows. This kind of analysis is highly relevant, especially at a time when emerging economies around the world are facing the repercussions of a potential monetary policy normalization in the United States and continuing quantitative easing measures by the European Central Bank, either of which could once again heighten the volatility of cross-border capital flows, thereby posing renewed macroeconomic challenges for major EMEs."},

It was struggling to define its role and justify its existence even as trouble was brewing in countries it would later help to rescue. To understand the Fund’s current strengths and weaknesses, a look back at this era is highly illuminating. Three major developments for the IMF, spanning the years 2005–2009, are chronicled. These developments merit extensive exploration for the insight they provide on controversies that have flared over the IMF’s role in the euro-zone crisis, the greatest the Fund has ever faced, and the resulting erosion of its credibility an independent, neutral arbiter and fixer of economic problems. Critics often blame the IMF’s governance problem, namely European dominance over the Fund’s board and management.

{"title": "Laid Low: The IMF, the Euro Zone and the First Rescue of Greece", "authors": ["Paul Blustein"], "publishing_date": "2015-04-07T16:08:00Z", "abstract": "As Greece descended into a financial maelstrom in the spring of 2010, a small group of staffers at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) held top-secret talks with officials from the German and French finance ministries to discuss the idea of restructuring Greece’s debt. Many independent analysts believed a restructuring was inevitable because the country’s debt burden appeared unsustainable. But instead, the “Troika” — the tripartite group of lenders that included the IMF, the European Commission and European Central Bank — attempted to resolve the crisis by giving Athens bailout loans of unprecedented magnitude, piling debt atop debt. The idea considered in those secret talks would come to fruition only much later, in March 2012, when Greece received the largest debt relief in history. In the meantime, the rescue effort would go terribly awry, with consequences that continue to reverberate today as the euro area struggles with weak growth and a rekindled crisis in Greece. This paper tells the story of the first Greek rescue, focusing on the role played by the IMF, and based on interviews with dozens of key participants as well as both public and private IMF documents. A detailed look back at this drama elucidates significant concerns about the Fund’s governance and its management of future crises."},
{"title": "Debt Reprofiling, Debt Restructuring and the Current Situation in Ukraine", "authors": ["Gregory Makoff"], "publishing_date": "2015-04-08T09:41:00Z", "abstract": "This paper discusses “debt reprofiling” — a relatively light form of sovereign debt restructuring in which the tenor of a government’s liabilities are extended in maturity, but coupons and principal are not cut — and how to distinguish one from deeper forms of debt restructuring. The International Monetary Fund has proposed making reprofiling the centrepiece of the proposed rewrite of its exceptional access policy that governs fund lending and debt restructuring conditionality when a member country seeks to borrow large sums. This policy would distinguish when creditors should suffer immediate losses (through a loss-inducing debt restructuring) from situations where creditors are simply required to remain in the game as a lender (through a reprofiling) and at risk to loss in future restructurings. Ukraine’s current situation is studied, where the government’s finances have been destabilized by the ongoing geopolitical conflict. The paper’s framework is used to argue that a reprofiling could have been a valuable tool during 2014 in the Fund’s initial financing for Ukraine — short-term creditors could have been prevented from exiting the system. "},

This is due to the Internet being a general purpose technology that alters society worldwide through its impact on pre-existing economic and social structures, and the Internet's already large impact is accelerated and amplified due to the network of effects. The twelfth in the Global Commission on Internet Governance paper series argues that it would be a serious mistake to continue to address Internet-related public policy in subject-area silos, and proposes using existing fora to coordinate at the institutional level to deliver better policy results within existing processes and mandates. "},
{"title": "Development of Sustainability and Green Banking Regulations: Existing Codes and Practices", "authors": ["Adeboye Oyegunle", "Olaf Weber"], "publishing_date": "2015-04-22T10:47:00Z", "abstract": "Interest in sustainable and green financial regulations has grown in recent years due in part to increasing climate-change risks for the financial sector alongside a need to integrate this sector into the green economy. Introducing a regulative approach would be a significant departure from the voluntary codes of conduct that banks currently rely on to integrate sustainability issues into their business. However, integration of sustainability aspects into financial regulations, domestically and internationally, could be a strong driver for achieving a transition to a sustainable economy. The experience of developing and emerging countries, such as China, Brazil, Bangladesh and Nigeria, where regulatory approaches have already been implemented, can be a crucial source of learning for industrialized countries."},
{"title": "Net Neutrality: Reflections on the Current Debate", "authors": ["Pablo Bello ", "Juan Jung"], "publishing_date": "2015-05-06T11:07:00Z", "abstract": "The debate over net neutrality began in the late 1990s in the United States. Since then, it has been gaining momentum in several fields, generating dichotomous positions between different sectors. As a contribution to the debate, this paper attempts to separate the unquestionable principles — such as the need to preserve the Internet as a space that is open to innovation, and the freedom of users to access content and services — from the dogmas and beliefs that are put forward in the name of neutrality, but which affect the sustainable development of the digital ecosystem. Telecommunications networks and services and providers of content over the Net uphold the digital ecosystem, and it is essential that both can develop sustainably, with equivalent regulations and principles. Meeting certain basic principles in favour of competition and against arbitrary discrimination would create the conditions for fostering the development of the digital ecosystem."},
{"title": "Domestic Sources and RMB Internationalization: A Unique Journey to a Major Global Currency", "authors": ["Alex He"], "publishing_date": "2015-05-12T15:03:00Z", "abstract": "This paper is based on literature reviews on the concept of an international currency and its economic and political determinants, as well as China’s motivation for renminbi (RMB) internationalization by both Chinese and foreign scholars. The paper concentrates on the political economy explanation of the road map of RMB internationalization the Chinese government currently pursues. Beginning in 2009, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) pushed RMB internationalization in a low-profile way through cross-border trade settlement, establishment of offshore RMB markets and swap agreements with other central banks, in spite of unfinished market-oriented reform on the exchange and interest rate, and a still strictly regulated capital account. The indirect and manageable approach toward RMB internationalization, in practice, leads to a de facto capital account liberalization."},

It is a major step in the economic and monetary integration of the European Union, and aims to end large taxpayer-funded bailouts and national policies that protect domestic banks at the expense of financial stability. This paper describes the rationale for banking union, four key pieces of legislation that constitute its legal foundation and two mechanism that form its key pillars. The ultimate test of whether banking union has worked, the paper concludes, is whether it will succeed in reversing the fragmentation in Europe’s financial system and breaking the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns."},

It established rights of Internet users, state obligations to foster Internet use, and duties and liabilities of companies — both Internet connection providers and Internet application providers. It thus challenges actors that purport to be digital and borderless to abide by a deeply national geographic law. The legislation was celebrated, from the user’s perspective, as one of the most innovative and protective Internet regulations in the world. Until recently, however, no systematic methodology existed to evaluate this kind of legislation on its strengths and weaknesses as a human rights framework. As the MCI will form the basis for other laws and judicial interpretation — in Brazil and elsewhere, including human rights laws — developing and standardizing a process to evaluate its human rights dimensions becomes essential. This paper takes the methodologies first developed by former United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression Frank La Rue and applies them to the MCI as a first step toward evaluating its treatment of human rights online."},

{"title": "The Impact of Financial Sector Sustainability Regulations on Banks", "authors": ["Olaf Weber", "Olawuwo Oni"], "publishing_date": "2015-10-01T14:08:00Z", "abstract": "This paper analyzes the impact of three financial sector sustainability regulations: the Chinese green credit guidelines, the Nigerian Sustainable Banking Principles and the Bangladesh Environmental Risk Management Guidelines. All three address the connection between financial sector activities and sustainable development, and develop guidelines for sustainable banking policies, strategies, practices, products and services. The paper concludes that, first, the mandatory guidelines have an impact on the sustainability performance of banks. In all three cases, sustainability performance increased after the introduction of the guidelines. Second, the inclusion of the banking sector into the development of financial sustainability regulations increases the success of the regulation. Third, activities to support the implementation of financial sustainability guidelines and supervising the compliance with the guidelines are crucial for the success of financial sector sustainability regulations. Fourth, financial sector sustainability regulations have a positive impact on both the financial sector’s financial performance and stability and sustainability performance. Finally, more research is needed to explore the impact of financial sector sustainability regulations on sustainable development."},
{"title": "Climate Technology Partnerships: Form, Function and Impact", "authors": ["Arunabha Ghosh", "Anupama Vijaykumar", "Sudatta Ray"], "publishing_date": "2015-10-27T11:09:00Z", "abstract": "With halting progress in climate negotiations, there are growing calls for partnerships among self-selected pools of countries, in the expectation that they would facilitate consensus (among both developed and developing countries) and result in faster decision making. In critically examining such a claim, this paper asks: what kinds of partnerships could facilitate coordinated climate-related action across several countries? By focusing largely on technology partnerships (a key demand in climate negotiations), it examines characteristics of successful partnerships and the conditions under which they are created and sustained. While the motivations of existing partnerships are diverse, their functional scope has remained limited. A review of more than 30 initiatives reveals that very few had been designed to extend beyond sharing knowledge and some preliminary research and development activities. Even fewer had enlarged functional focus on actual transfer of equipment, joint production or extensive deployment mandates. The paper intensively analyzes the purpose, membership and governance of four partnerships. Drawing on their lessons, the paper identifies critical features — appropriate financing, leveraging capacity, flexible intellectual property rules and coordination across several institutions — which could become the foundation of new partnerships to deliver measurable action and possibly increase trust among negotiating parties."},

The RMB’s Inclusion in the SDR Basket", "authors": ["Hongying Wang"], "publishing_date": "2015-12-04T10:46:00Z", "abstract": "The International Monetary Fund recently concluded its quinquennial review of the composition of the Special Drawing Right (SDR), accepting the Chinese currency into the SDR basket alongside four major international currencies — the US dollar, the euro, the British pound and the Japanese yen. The Chinese government has spent a great deal of energy and political capital to achieve this outcome. This policy paper explains China’s interest in this seemingly exotic and technical pursuit, identifying the political and economic motivations underlying this initiative. It discusses the controversial reactions to China’s bid for the SDR basket from the international community and from various groups within China. It also explores some plausible and implausible consequences of the renminbi’s (RMB’s) inclusion in the SDR basket. It argues that the inclusion of the Chinese currency in the SDR basket may well play a facilitating role in China’s financial liberalization, but it does not in itself transform the RMB into a global reserve currency. The latter will involve a more protracted process, requiring serious institutional reforms in China."},

{"title": "When CO2 Goes to Geneva: Taxing Carbon across Borders  —  Without Violating WTO Obligations", "authors": ["Maria Panezi"], "publishing_date": "2015-11-27T16:57:00Z", "abstract": "This paper discusses how trade and the environment can intersect in the case of carbon taxes. Carbon taxes become relevant for international trade when they are coupled with border tax adjustment (BTA) legislation for imported products. BTAs are optional taxes or duties imposed on imports in order to ensure similar market conditions for similar domestic and imported products, when the domestic products are already taxed nationally. BTAs, in the case of products with a high carbon footprint, are equivalent to taxation imposed on similar domestic products with the same amounts of CO2 emitted during their production. BTAs are intended to level the playing field between domestic and foreign products. Such tax schemes, if not designed properly, can be found to violate a country’s international commitments before the World Trade Organization (WTO)."},
{"title": "Climate Change and Human Rights: How? Where? When?", "authors": ["Basil Ugochukwu"], "publishing_date": "2015-11-27T17:06:00Z", "abstract": "Actions taken to mitigate and adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change must be centred on human rights. In negotiations for a binding international climate change instrument, nation states have been called upon to fully respect human rights in all climate-related actions. As important as this demand is, there is also the need to describe and plan how human rights can be integrated into national, subnational and corporate climate change strategies. This paper analyzes a few examples of national, subnational and corporate climate change policies to show how they have either enshrined human rights principles, or failed to do so. It also examines the challenge of integrating human rights principles in climate change actions. Climate change policies, if they are to respect all human rights, must actually use human rights language to articulate adaptation or mitigation measures."},
{"title": "Combatting Cyber Threats: CSIRTs and Fostering International Cooperation on Cybersecurity", "authors": ["Samantha Bradshaw"], "publishing_date": "2015-12-08T16:13:00Z", "abstract": "The increasing visibility and sophistication of cyber attacks, coupled with the global interconnection and dependence of the Internet, has created a need not only for specialized skills in the prevention of and response to cyber attacks but also for cooperation on a global scale. A “cyber regime complex” is emerging as governments, the private sector, the technical community and non-governmental organizations cooperate to secure cyberspace. Computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) are key actors in the cyber regime complex that help the broader Internet community prevent and respond to cyber incidents through incident analysis and response, information sharing and dissemination, and skills training. Teams generally agree that cooperation could be strengthened through the enhanced and timely exchange of cyber threat information. However, a number of complex legal questions and a lack of trust among community members have discouraged sharing. This paper examines the role of CSIRTs in the emerging cyber regime complex and asks what might be driving the lack of trust and information sharing within the community. The commercialization of cyber security and threat vulnerabilities, the Internet’s development as a new power domain, the growth of the CSIRT community and the emergence of a cyber regime complex are examined as factors that are giving rise to and exacerbating existing problems around information sharing and trust."},
{"title": "Is Indonesia the Next China?", "authors": ["Wendy K. Dobson"], "publishing_date": "2016-02-09T14:38:00Z", "abstract": "This paper reviews Indonesia’s economic prospects and what these imply for a closer relationship with Canada. By posing the question “Is Indonesia the next China?,” the author suggests that Indonesia has the considerable economic potential envisaged by foreign investors, but conveys uncertainty as to whether Southeast Asia’s most populous country can make the changes necessary to realize that potential. A review of the economic record and comparison of China’s and Indonesia’s economic structures, endowments and institutions show major differences between the two countries. The paper further questions what it will take to realize Indonesia’s potential, finding the answers to be: human capital development; increased participation in the region’s global value chains; meeting the growing middle-class demand for modern services; raising productivity in agriculture and fishing; and increasing use of the Internet. Failure to make these changes will increase the chances of Indonesia’s growth in per capita incomes slowing and falling into the middle-income trap. Canada’s role will be to monitor closely how Indonesia tackles its five priorities at the same time as it responds to the opportunities to exploit Indonesia’s abundant natural resources, urbanization and its expanding consumer demand for modern services and educational opportunities."},

One of its main components is a chapter that seeks to liberalize trade and investment in financial services between Canada and the European Union, while ensuring that markets and their agents will be properly regulated and protected through prudential regulation. However, this chapter is unlikely to have a significant impact on the financial services sector in Canada and the European Union in the short and medium term. Although some observers fear that CETA might undermine the high quality of financial regulations in Canada or the European Union, this paper’s analysis demonstrates that such concerns are unfounded."},

{"title": "A Threat to Stability? Islamic Extremism and Fundamentalism in Indonesia", "authors": ["Jacques Bertrand", "Jessica Soedirgo"], "publishing_date": "2016-03-21T11:06:00Z", "abstract": "Although the January 2016 Sarinah mall attacks in Jakarta demonstrate the need for continued vigilance, this paper argues that Islamic extremism and fundamentalism are not on the rise in Indonesia. In fact, Islamic extremism in Indonesia reached its height in the early 2000s, with radicalized groups participating in religious conflicts in Eastern Indonesia and carrying out large-scale terrorist attacks, such as the bombings in Bali in 2002. Since then, the capacity of the security apparatus has markedly improved, leading to the crippling of terrorist networks. Today, the majority of Islamists engage in above-ground non-violent activities and pose little threat to the country’s stability. This paper views fundamentalism and extremism as symptoms of broader problems in Indonesia, and argues that addressing these issues should help to further reduce the problems of religious fundamentalism and extremism."},

{"title": "China and Global Energy Governance under the G20 Framework", "authors": ["Alex He"], "publishing_date": "2016-03-29T09:00:00Z", "abstract": "This paper explores China’s perspectives and practices in its quest for overseas energy supply security and its participation in international energy cooperation since becoming a net oil import country in 1993. It compares the traditional approach, in which China mainly focuses on bilateral means to pursue its overseas energy supply security, and the new concept of energy security, in which greater involvement in global energy governance, in particular in the Group of Twenty (G20), is highlighted to promote China’s energy security. The paper argues that China still retains a bilateral and regional cooperation approach, while making progress in developing closer cooperation with existing major global energy governing institutions. The One Belt, One Road strategy proposed in 2013 is regarded as a strengthened version of the bilateral and regional cooperation approach. Chinese academic circles constitute the main forces advocating China’s more positive participation in global energy governance. The G20 provides significant institutional arrangements to coordinate big powers to govern the international energy markets and to address climate change. This paper suggests that, given China’s growing prominence at the G20, it could be the proper platform for the country to play a more active role in global energy governance."},

As connectivity and Internet penetration increase, so do the conflicts between jurisdictions. Such conflicts challenge the Westphalian international system, and traditional modes of legal cooperation struggle to resolve these jurisdictional tensions. Extreme application of the principle of territoriality and the exertion of digital sovereignty put the global community on a dangerous path if employed on the global scale. If nothing is done, this legal arms race could lead to severe unintended consequences for the future of the global digital economy, human rights, the technical Internet infrastructure and security."},
